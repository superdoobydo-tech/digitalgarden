Cyberware Categories
🧠 Neuralware (Cognitive Enhancements)
Focused on processing speed, memory, and interface control. Ideal for Hackers, Archivists, and Synths.
• 	Neural Interface: Direct connection to networks and drones
• 	Reflex Boosters: Faster reaction time and initiative
• 	Memory Vault: Eidetic recall and encrypted data storage
• 	Emotion Dampeners: Suppress fear, guilt, or empathy
• 	Ghost Protocol: Allows partial consciousness upload or split focus
👁 Sensoryware (Perception Enhancements)
Enhances awareness, targeting, and environmental control. Favored by Wraiths, Street Docs, and Cultists.
• 	Ocular Mods: Thermal, night vision, zoom, and HUD overlays
• 	Auditory Filters: Selective hearing, sonar mapping
• 	Bio-Scanners: Detect life signs, cyberware, or toxins
• 	Sensory Cloak: Obscures presence from detection systems
• 	Pain Mapping: Redirect or nullify physical trauma
💪 Bodyware (Physical Enhancements)
Built for strength, durability, and combat. Common among Gangsters, Drone Techs, and Scrappers.
• 	Dermal Plating: Subdermal armor against ballistics and blades
• 	Hydraulic Limbs: Enhanced strength and melee impact
• 	Adrenal Surge: Temporary boost to physical stats
• 	Weapon Ports: Built-in blades, guns, or shock emitters
• 	Auto-Stabilizers: Improved aim and recoil control


🧩 Cyberware Rules
Cyberware represents the physical and cognitive enhancements that define your character’s edge in the cyberpunk world. It is not tracked with Discipline dots, but instead managed narratively and through interaction with the Suffer stat.
🧠 Neuralware (Cognitive Enhancements)
Enhances mental processing, reflexes, and interface control.
• 	Neural Interface: Direct connection to networks and drones
• 	Reflex Boosters: Faster reaction time and initiative
• 	Memory Vault: Eidetic recall and encrypted data storage
• 	Emotion Dampeners: Suppress fear, guilt, or empathy

⚠️ Cyberware Stress & Suffer Interaction
Cyberware use may increase Suffer under the following conditions:
• 	Overclocking or pushing enhancements beyond safe limits
• 	Sustaining damage to cybernetic systems
• 	Using unstable, black-market, or prototype mods
• 	Failing a Making Ends Meat roll while dependent on high-maintenance cyberware


Narrative Consequences of high Suffer from cyberware may include:
• 	Glitches: Malfunctions, sensory overload, feedback loops
• 	Breakdown: Emotional instability, compulsions, paranoia
• 	System Failure: Temporary loss of enhancements or forced shutdown
• 	Identity Drift: Blurring of self, memory corruption, AI bleed


⚠️ Cyberware Rating & Humanity
As characters install more cyberware and push their systems beyond natural limits, they risk losing touch with their humanity.
• 	Cyberware Rating reflects the total intensity and integration of enhancements.
• 	Thresholds: When your Cyberware Rating exceeds certain narrative or mechanical thresholds (e.g., 3+, 5+, etc.), your Humanity score may decrease.
• 	Triggers for Humanity Loss:
• 	Installing invasive or experimental cyberware
• 	Replacing organic systems with synthetic ones
• 	Failing a Suffer roll while heavily augmented
• 	Performing actions that violate Convictions due to cyberware influence
Narrative Consequences:
• 	Emotional detachment
• 	Identity drift or derealization
• 	Difficulty connecting with Touchstones
• 	Increased susceptibility to compulsions
This mechanic reinforces the core theme: the more you enhance, the more you risk becoming something else.


### ⚙️ Determining Cyberware Rating

Cyberware Rating reflects how deeply a character is modified by synthetic enhancements. It influences narrative tone, potential Suffer increases, and Humanity degradation.

#### 🧮 Starting Cyberware Rating

- **Default Starting Rating**: 1  
- **Background Influence**: Some backgrounds begin with higher Cyberware Ratings:
  - **Corpo, Hacker, Synth, Drone Tech**: Start at **2**
  - **Street Doc, Splicer, Wraith**: Choose between **1 or 2**
  - **Nomad, Scrapper, Archivist, Cultist, Gangster**: Start at **1**

#### 📈 Increasing Cyberware Rating

Cyberware Rating increases when characters:

- Install new enhancements (especially invasive or high-tier mods)
- Replace organic systems with synthetic ones
- Accept black-market or unstable upgrades
- Fail a **Suffer** roll while heavily augmented

> Optional Rule: Every **3 installed cyberware modules** increases Cyberware Rating by **+1**

#### 🧠 Cyberware Rating Effects

| **Cyberware Rating** | **Narrative Impact** | **Humanity Risk** | **Suffer Sensitivity** |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1                    | Minor enhancements   | None              | Low                     |
| 2                    | Noticeable mods      | Possible loss     | Moderate                |
| 3                    | Heavily augmented    | Humanity check    | High                    |
| 4+                   | Post-human territory | Frequent loss     | Severe                  |

> At **Rating 3+**, characters may begin to lose Touchstones or experience identity drift.

    - **Intimidation**: Psychological warfare and fear tactics
        


## ðŸ›  Feeding Equivalent: Making Ends Meat

In this cyberpunk setting, vampires no longer feed on bloodâ€”they survive by **making ends meat**, a catch-all term for acquiring the resources, data, energy, or influence needed to sustain their existence and cyberware.

- Each characterâ€™s **Predator Type** determines how they acquire sustenance.
- Failing to make ends meat triggers a **Suffer** increaseâ€”a renamed Hunger mechanic representing strain, scarcity, and system degradation.

### Predator Types & Resource Styles

| **Predator Type**     | **Resource Style**                            | **Examples**                                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Street Reclaimer      | Takes what they need by force                 | Mugging, extortion, scavenging                    |
| Social Hacker         | Seduces and manipulates for access            | Blackmail, seduction, social engineering          |
| Network Leech         | Feeds off digital or social systems           | Data siphoning, identity theft, botnet farming    |
| Corporate Parasite    | Exploits bureaucracy and corporate loopholes  | Embezzlement, insider trading, policy abuse       |
| Ritual Feeder         | Uses techno-mysticism or coded rites          | AI communion, sacrificial upgrades, ritual hacks  |
| Proxy Broker          | Delegates feeding through agents or drones    | Automated theft, remote manipulation              |

### ðŸŽ² Making Ends Meat Roll

At regular intervals (e.g., nightly, weekly, or per scene), players roll to determine whether their character successfully sustains themselves.

- **Success**: No change to Suffer.
- **Failure**: Increase **Suffer**, which may lead to:
  - Glitches
  - Emotional instability
  - Cyberware backlash
  - Narrative complications

## ðŸ”¥ Suffer

**Suffer** replaces Hunger and Cyberware Rating as the core mechanic tracking survival strain.

- Rises when:
  - You fail a Making Ends Meat roll
  - Cyberware malfunctions or exceeds safe thresholds (details TBD)
- May trigger compulsions, breakdowns, or system failures
- Can be reduced through rest, repair, or narrative relief
   

### Advantages & Flaws

Spend points on:

- **Backgrounds**: Allies, Resources, Fame, Safehouses
    
- **Merits**: Iron Will, Eidetic Memory, Cybernetic Reflexes
    
- **Flaws**: Enemy, Addiction, System Trace, Glitched Implant
    

### Humanity, Convictions & Touchstones

- **Humanity**: Starts at 7
    
- **Convictions**: Personal moral codes (e.g., "Never harm a child")
    
- **Touchstones**: Mortals or memories that anchor your humanity
    

### Blood Potency, Willpower & Health

- **Blood Potency â†’ Cyberware Rating**: Starts at 1
    
- **Willpower**: Based on Resolve + Composure
    
- **Health**: Based on Stamina + Fortitude (if applicable)
    

### Finish with Chronicle Tenets & Coterie

- Align with the campaignâ€™s moral boundaries.
    
- Define your characterâ€™s role in the **crew** (cyberpunk coterie).

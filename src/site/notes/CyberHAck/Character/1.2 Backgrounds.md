## Who Are the Hackers?

Hackers are the ghosts in the machine, the digital phantoms who slip through firewalls and social constructs with equal ease. While the obvious candidates for Hacker backgrounds are coders, cryptographers, and rogue sysadmins, the true essence of this archetype lies in their relationship with truth, control, and anonymity. A promising Hacker character isn’t just good with code—they understand the architecture of power and how to rewrite it.

Some Hackers are anarchists, seeking to dismantle oppressive systems. Others are mercenaries, selling access and secrets to the highest bidder. Still others are archivists of forbidden knowledge, preserving what others would erase. Whether they operate from neon-lit basements, abandoned server farms, or encrypted cloud bunkers, Hackers are defined by their ability to see what others cannot—and to act before anyone knows they were there.

Hackers often come across as aloof or cryptic, their minds tuned to frequencies most people can’t hear. But beneath the layers of obfuscation, many are deeply principled, guided by personal codes that may seem arcane but are fiercely upheld. They might expose a corrupt megacorp, leak a politician’s secrets, or erase a digital identity to protect a friend. Their morality is not always legible—but it is rarely absent.

Hacker mentors seek out proteges with a knack for pattern recognition, a hunger for forbidden knowledge, and a willingness to disappear. Whether they’re building decentralized networks or dismantling surveillance states, Hackers are the architects of digital rebellion. They rarely seek public recognition, but their fingerprints are everywhere.

Cyberpunk Powers

- **Cyberware**: Neural implants, datajacks, and sensory mods that enhance hacking ability and digital perception.
- **Obfuscate**: Reflavored as stealth protocols, cloaking fields, and identity scramblers.
- **Intimidation**: Used not through brute force, but through psychological manipulation, blackmail, and data leverage.

Compulsion: Exposure

The Hacker is compelled to uncover hidden truths or expose deception. For one scene, they must reveal a secret, breach a system, or confront a lie. Failing to do so imposes a three-dice penalty to all rolls until the compulsion is satisfied or the scene ends.

Hacker Archetypes

**Codebreaker**  
Specializes in cracking encrypted systems and bypassing digital defenses. Often hired for high-risk infiltrations or data thefts. Their loyalty is rare—but absolute when earned.

**Signal Phantom**  
Exists almost entirely in the digital realm. Their physical presence is minimal, but their influence is vast. They manipulate feeds, rewrite narratives, and vanish without trace.

**Data Leech**  
Feeds off stolen secrets, identities, and behavioral patterns. They know everyone’s weaknesses and use them with surgical precision. Some are blackmail artists; others are digital prophets.


Who Are the Corpos?

Corpos are the architects of control—executives, strategists, and visionaries who shape the world from behind encrypted glass and biometric vaults. While the obvious candidates for Corpo backgrounds are CEOs, analysts, and corporate enforcers, the true essence of the archetype lies in their belief that systems, not individuals, determine fate. A promising Corpo character isn’t just powerful—they understand how to build empires that outlive them.

Some Corpos are ruthless, others refined. They might run a megacorp’s black-ops division, manage a portfolio of human assets, or manipulate city-wide infrastructure through shell companies and proxy wars. Their havens are high-rise penthouses, server bunkers, or mobile command centers. Their tools are contracts, drones, and silence.

Corpo mentors seek out proteges with ambition, discipline, and a willingness to sacrifice. Whether they’re grooming successors or building disposable pawns, they value loyalty and vision above all. Many Corpos operate within the city’s dominant factions, but some defect to rogue syndicates or form their own shadow conglomerates. Their allegiance is always strategic.

Despite their cold exterior, some Corpos are deeply philosophical—obsessed with legacy, order, and the illusion of permanence. They may fund underground art movements, curate forbidden archives, or maintain secret sanctuaries for those they deem “worthy.” Others are pure predators, feeding on chaos and monetizing despair.

Cyberpunk Powers

- **Cyberware**: Executive-grade implants, neural firewalls, and command protocols.
- **Intimidation**: Used through leverage, reputation, and psychological dominance.
- **Heavy Weapons**: Access to corporate-grade armaments and security drones.

Compulsion: Domination

The Corpo is compelled to assert control over a situation, person, or system. For one scene, they must impose their will—through command, manipulation, or force. Failing to do so imposes a three-dice penalty to all rolls until the compulsion is satisfied or the scene ends.

Corpo Archetypes

**Fixer**  
Broker of deals, favors, and blackmail. The Fixer knows everyone’s price and keeps the city’s gears turning—quietly, efficiently, and with plausible deniability.

**Executive Ghost**  
A vanished CEO still manipulating the market from the shadows. Their name is erased, but their influence lingers in every merger, scandal, and power shift.

**Asset Manager**  
Curates people like portfolios, discarding liabilities and investing in potential. They maintain dossiers, contingency plans, and exit strategies for everyone they meet.

**Brand Prophet**  
Shapes culture through media, fashion, and viral campaigns. They weaponize aesthetics and ideology, turning public opinion into a commodity.

**Compliance Warden**  
Enforces corporate law with surgical precision. Whether through legalese or lethal force, they ensure that rules are followed—and rewritten when needed.

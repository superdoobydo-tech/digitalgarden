# Bosa Taming and Training

“…*They ain’t quite animals but they ain’t monsters neither—folks on the northern islands say Bosa evolved from fragments of the gods. By training and strengthening these creatures, humans aid their return to divinity. Bosa live to challenge one another, honing their power until they vanish back into godhood—carrying legends of honor, partnership, and rich reward for those who guide them*.”

## Bosa Basics

- Intelligent fragments of deities that have taken on a new centiant form,  and driven to fight peers in pursuit of wholeness.
    
- View humans as partners, not pets; they spar to sharpen their skills.
    
- Never intervene in human conflicts; their sole instinct is to hone power against other Bosa and driven to fight peers in pursuit of wholeness.
    
- Trainers earn honor and treasure by helping Bosa evolve and “go home” to the gods.
    

## Bosa Bracelets and Bands

Bosa Bracelets and Bands correspond to a single Bosa type and allow Soul Binding of up to three Bosa. Each item has one gem slot by default and can be upgraded to five slots (1,500 gp per additional slot). Gems grant bonuses to binding, battle prowess, or utility.Bosa can Soul Bind with a Bosa Bracelet giving its

owner the ability to summon the creature at will.

Bracelets correspond with a Bosa Type and can

only be used to Soul Bind that particular type. Bosa

bracelets may also have up to 5 slots, these can be

fitted with gems that can make Soul Binding Bosa

easier (Gems are removable)

### Writ Types

| Bosa Bracelets and Bands | Form     | Captures     |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| Water Crest              | Crest    | Water Bosa   |
| Foresight Band           | Band     | Psychic Bosa |

## Soul Binding
2. Forego your Bosa’s action to attempt a bind.
    
3. Roll 1d20 + Bracelet modifier vs. the Bosa’s Catch DR.
    
4. On success, the Bosa is added to your bracelet.
    
5. On failure, the Bosa makes a Run roll to flee.
    
6. If a Bosa reaches 0 HP, you gain one final bind attempt; failure means it escapes permanently.
    

Bound Bosa may come and go as they please—summoning does not guarantee obedience.

## Learning New Attacks

- Each Bosa knows up to four moves at once.
    
- New attacks come from special items (Glow Salts, Trinkets) or via Evolution/Gifts.
    
- If all four slots are full, you must forget an existing move or decline the new one.
    
- Evolved forms inherit up to four moves from prior stages.

## Glow Salts: Learning New Attacks
Glow Salts are crystalline remnants of Bosa energy, each carrying the memory of one potent attack. When consumed, a Bosa permanently learns that attack—either a normal-type move or an elemental ability matching its own type.

### Mechanics

- Single-use item; feeding takes 1 minute of focus.
    
- No roll required—learning is guaranteed.
    
- Elemental salts must match the Bosa’s type; normal salts work on any Bosa.
    
- The learned attack is permanent in the Bosa’s move list.

|---|---|---|---|
|Salt of the Howling|Bite|Normal|Common; found in ancient caves|
|Salt of the Ember|Flame Lash|Fire|Fire Bosa only|

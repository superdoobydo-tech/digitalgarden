# Bosa Tamin’ and Trainin’

> “They ain’t quite animals but they ain’t monsters neither—folks on the northern islands say Bosa evolved from fragments of the gods. By training and strengthening these creatures, humans aid their return to divinity. Bosa live to challenge one another, honing their power until they vanish back into godhood—carrying legends of honor, partnership, and rich reward for those who guide them.”

---

## Bosa Basics

- Intelligent fragments of deities in sentient form, driven to fight peers in pursuit of wholeness.
- View humans as partners, not pets; they spar to sharpen their skills.
- Never intervene in human conflicts; their sole instinct is to hone power against other Bosa.
- Trainers earn honor and treasure by helping Bosa evolve and “go home” to the gods.
- Bound Bosa may come and go as they please—summoning does not guarantee obedience.

## Bosa Anatomy (SWADE Notes)

- **Catch Rating**  
    Number of successes or raises needed to Soul Bind a Bosa.
    
- **Bond**  
    Bond measures the soul-link between trainer and Bosa on a scale from 0 to 10.
    
    - Gain +1 Bond for each battle victory, shared triumph, or meaningful moment (GM’s discretion).
    - At Bond 6, the Bosa awakens its latent passive ability.
    - If Bond ever falls to 0, the Soul Bind shatters and the Bosa’s loyalty dissolves.

- **Elemental Type**  
     Bosa have a type (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Psychic, Ghost). Type determines move access and damage modifiers: attacks against a weakness deal +2 damage; against resistance deal -2.
    
- **Moves**  
    Each Bosa can learn up to 4 moves. Moves use modified Powers from the SWADE core book.

## Echo Bands

Echo Bands allow a trainer to Soul Bind (catch) Bosa of a matching type. A bound Bosa can be summoned at will, though it may refuse commands.

- Only Echo Bands matching a Bosa’s type can bind that Bosa.
- Each band has up to 5 gem slots (1 open by default).
- Capacity: binds up to 3 Bosa per band. You may own multiple bands but only one is active at a time.

|Echo Band|Form|Type|
|---|---|---|
|Water Crest|Crest|Water|
|Foresight Band|Band|Psychic|
|Infernal Bracer|Bracer|Fire|
|Ghastly Bracelet|Bracelet|Ghost|
|Earth Band|Band|Earth|
|Omni Bracelet|Bracelet|Any|

## Soul Binding

To Soul Bind a wild Bosa, a trainer uses their action to make an opposed roll.

1. **Declare Attempt (Action).** If your Bosa is present, it forfeits its action this round.
2. **Opposed Roll.**
    - Bosa rolls its type-based Attribute (e.g., Fire → Agility).
    - Trainer rolls the Skill or Attribute specified by the Echo Band.
3. **Modifiers.**
    - Bosa Shaken: Trainer +2
    - Per Wound on Bosa: Trainer +1 (max +3)
    - Prior rapport/quest-tie: Trainer +2
    - Wrong-type band: trainer skips turn
    - Hallowed ground (Bosa’s type): Bosa +2
4. **Outcomes.**
    - **Success:** Bosa binds, add to band.
    - **Raise:** As success, and Bosa is Loyal for this scene.
    - **Failure:** Bosa attempts to flee on its next action.
    - **Critical Failure:** Bosa is Enraged (+2 damage for one round; free Taunt).
5. **Final Attempt.** If Bosa is Incapacitated, you may attempt one last free bind. On failure, its fragment dissipates permanently.
6. **Obedience Clause.** Summoning does not guarantee obedience; see Command & Obedience rules.

## Glow Salts: Learning New Attacks

Glow Salts are crystalline remnants carrying a Bosa’s attack memory.

- **Use Time:** 1 minute of focused feeding, out of combat.
- **Success:** Automatic; if Bosa already knows 4 moves, it must forget one.
- **Type Lock:** Elemental salts must match the Bosa’s type; normal salts are universal.
- **Slotting:** Assign the new move to any open slot (1–4); some ornaments reference slot numbers.

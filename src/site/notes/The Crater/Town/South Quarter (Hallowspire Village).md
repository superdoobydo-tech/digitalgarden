#### Hollowmere - South Quarter: Housing and Warehouse

A densely packed residential zone where families live in cramped tenements surrounded by decaying warehouses. The air is heavy with dust and desperation. Laborers shuffle between home and work, and the Crimson Council's patrols keep unrest in check.

**Quartermaster Sera Mourn**: A stoic and calculating woman, Sera Mourn ensures the town's housing and labor systems run with ruthless efficiency. Her presence is quiet but commanding, and she is known for her unflinching enforcement of quotas and resource distribution.






# Mysteries

## **What Happened to the Artists?**

Sutter and his followers developed limited magical abilities due to a leak in the Ether Lake's echo chamber while living in Hallowspire. In the weeks before the ban, Sutter's powers intensified—he entered fugue states and painted visions of the future.

The mayor's discovery of the commune's secret came not from a public display, but from a confiscated sketchbook found during a routine inspection of the tavern. Inside were pages of surreal imagery—twisted depictions of divine symbols, distorted portraits of village leaders, and one chilling image: the Spire of Law crumbling into the Ether Lake. Alarmed, the mayor ordered a covert investigation.

Guards infiltrated the Artists' Quarter under the guise of census takers, reporting strange and abnormal behavior among the residents. Eventually, magic users were discovered and exiled.


Romors and Hear say
    - **Disease in the Artist District** – The mayor framed the exile as a response to an uncurable disease, spreading rumors of contagion to justify the purge.
    
- **Liora's Song** – A haunting melody that lingers in the tavern, said to awaken dormant magic in those who hear it. Some claim it was the first sign of the seal weakening.
    
- **Sutter's Visions** – Paintings that depict future events, some of which have already come true. His final work before exile showed the mayor devouring the village's harvest—a metaphor that sparked panic and crackdown.
    
- The tavern knows. Jorren’s ale tastes different. He’s seen speaking to shadows. The tavern’s cellar door is always locked now.




### Sutters Room

- _The mayor, hunched and shadowed, stealing coins from a village coffer—his eyes hollow, his hands stained with ink and blood._
    
- _Elric, the Tinkerer, curled in sleep beneath the earth, surrounded by glowing runes and fractured machinery—his breath syncing with the pulse of the Echo Gate._
    
- _The western ruins, bathed in divine light, with silhouettes of unknown figures watching from the treeline._
    
- _The world itself, split down the middle—one half aflame, the other drowned in stars and silence._
    
- _A player character, depicted in the exact clothes they wore upon arrival, standing at the edge of a broken bridge, staring into the Ether Lake._

#### Stonegate - North Quarter: Gate Defense and Militia Training
The militarized edge of town, where recruits train under harsh conditions and fortifications guard against external threats. The gate is both a barrier and a symbol of isolation. Discipline is strict, and failure is punished severely.

**Commander Kael Vorn**: A battle-scarred veteran, Kael Vorn leads the Crimson Guard with iron discipline. He is revered by his troops and feared by civilians. Vorn believes in strength through suffering and trains his militia to endure pain as a path to loyalty.

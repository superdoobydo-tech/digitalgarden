The ownership is unaware of where the bars name comes from other than it is named after the lady on the statue in the [[East District\|East District]]. 

This lively tavern nestled in the heart of the city, known for its nightly performances and strong drinks. The establishment is owned by Beran Nareth, a stern, no-nonsense man who doesn't tolerate foolishness. Beran is a skilled fighter with a commanding presence, and while he deeply loves his daughter, Persephony, he often expresses it in a gruff and dismissive manner.

Persephony is a bard from the Music District who works at Liora's Cup as both a waitress and entertainer. Despite her talent, she struggles with self-confidence due to her father's harsh critiques. Her performances are heartfelt, and she dreams of earning his respect and proving her worth on stage.

The tavern is a hub for adventurers, artists, and locals seeking a place to unwind, making it a vibrant and sometimes chaotic cornerstone of the community.

Lost PIXIE HERE - [[The Crater/Town/Oath-breakers Shrine (Dream Web)\|Oath-breakers Shrine (Dream Web)]]



Recently, a leak from the Echo Gate in a nearby town has released enough ether to stir the colony once more. Some pixies have begun to awaken, their memories fragmented and their magic unstable. They speak of the lake’s sealing as a betrayal, and their revival may hold the key to restoring balance—or unleashing forgotten powers.

The party may encounter newly awakened pixies who are confused, volatile, or desperate to reconnect with the ether. Their plight adds urgency to the climb, as the mountain’s magic stirs in response to their return.

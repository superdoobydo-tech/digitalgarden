**Mist Elk** - Large, elusive elk that appear only during the pale mist. Their antlers resemble twisted branches, and they move silently through the fog. Villagers consider sightings of Mist Elk to be signs of spiritual harmony.
# Graveyard

_The graveyard that contains the crypt lies near the edge of the Whispering Woods, shrouded in mist and silence. Overgrown paths twist through high grass and tangled vines, while cracked stone markers lean as if whispering secrets to the wind. Few dare linger here, for the air hums with forgotten names and the weight of unseen watchers. 

It's always foggy due to its proximity to the Whispering Woods.

## The Null Choir

_The Null Choir is a cryptid born from the collapse of a forgotten experiment in sonic containment. It is a being of pure auditory hunger, drawn to vibration, resonance, and memory. It is said to be the fused remnants of those who died in a failed attempt to silence the Whispering Woods itself—a ritual that backfired and birthed a creature that consumes all sound._

**Appearance**
_The Null Choir appears as a tall figure stitched from shadow and bone, with three glowing eyes and gaping holes on the sides of its head that act as ears. Its form flickers like a broken projection, limbs jerking in unnatural rhythms. Where its mouth should be is a gaping void that hums with dissonant resonance. It leaves no footprints, but the air around it grows still and heavy. All sound within its presence is devoured—creating a deafening silence that presses against the ears like a scream withheld._

### **Mechanics**

- Foggy Graveyard: -2 vision
    
- Bright Light Sensitivity: The Null Choir recoils from sudden, intense light. _Effect_: If exposed to daylight or magical light (e.g., _daylight_, _sunburst_), it must make a DC 15 Constitution save or be stunned for 1 round.
    
- **Sound-Eater**: The Null Choir grows stronger the louder the environment becomes. It feeds on vibration, voice, and music.
    
- **Echo Trigger**: Any spoken name, musical note, or sudden noise awakens its attention.
    
- **Deafening Silence**: All sound within a 30-foot radius of the Null Choir is nullified. This is not a spell, but a passive effect of its presence. Spells with verbal components fail, communication is impossible, and the silence itself causes psychic strain. _Effect_: DC 14 Constitution save or take 1d6 psychic damage per round. After 1d6 rounds of exposure, characters gain the mute hindrance unless the Null Choir is defeated.
    
- **Resonant Collapse**: If exposed to overwhelming sound—such as a thunderous performance or sonic burst—it temporarily loses cohesion, flickering violently and retreating into the mist.

#### Gravemarket - East Quarter: Engineering and Shopping

A hub of innovation and commerce, where tinkerers and tradespeople work in cluttered workshops and storefronts. The Crimson Council keeps a close eye on technological developments, wary of anything that might disrupt their rule. Black-market goods and whispered deals can cost one their life.

**Tinkermaster Drell Varn**: A brilliant but paranoid inventor, Drell Varn oversees all engineering and technological activity. He is known for his obsession with control and his tendency to dismantle anything he cannot understand. His workshop is a maze of gears, wires, and surveillance devices.

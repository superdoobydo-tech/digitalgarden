#### Hollowmere - South Quarter: Housing and Warehouse

A densely packed residential zone where families live in cramped tenements surrounded by decaying warehouses. The air is heavy with dust and desperation. Laborers shuffle between home and work, and the Crimson Council's patrols keep unrest in check.

**Quartermaster Sera Mourn**: A stoic and calculating woman, Sera Mourn ensures the town's housing and labor systems run with ruthless efficiency. Her presence is quiet but commanding, and she is known for her unflinching enforcement of quotas and resource distribution.

#### **Bud's Bits (Koarn)**

A trinket shop in someone's garage in Hollowmere. It is full of well-used household goods, mechanical bits, and expensive old manuals. It's run by a young, redheaded woman and her grizzled father. They are maintenance and engineering employees by day, and enjoy drinking, haggling, and yelling.

- **Secret:** They run a **black market** in the back of the shop at night.

The Crater is a small region locked off from the rest of the world, it contains:

[[The Crater/Hallowspire Village\| Hallowspire Village (Human Settlement)]], 
[[The Crater/Town/Cities and Sectors/Widow's Peak Caverns (Venrathi Stronghold)\|Widow's Peak Caverns (Venrathi Stronghold)]], 

**Ruined Temple of Burset: The Drowned Sanctum** - Once a grand cathedral devoted to Burset, god of death, now submerged and crumbling beneath a marsh. Its flooded halls contain relics of divine resonance, corrupted prayer scrolls, and bone-crafted Vanrathi artifacts. Sutter Cain seeks its lost murals, which depict the Sundering in forbidden detail. Vanrathi scouts believe the temple's drowned sanctum may still echo with Burset's final lament.

**Tinkerer's Resting Place** - A hidden mausoleum deep in the Whispering Woods, where the original Tinkerer was buried with his harmonic tools. The resting place contains the key to the Echo Chamber—a crystalline tuning fork that resonates with Liora's final song. The tomb is protected by mechanical guardians and memory traps that replay fragments of the Sundering.

**[[The Crater/Hallowspire Village\|Hallowspire Village]]** - A bleak, isolated town nestled in the shadow of the Hallowspire Mountains. Its architecture is utilitarian and oppressive, divided into four districts. The town is governed by authoritarian rule, with rituals and shame-culture enforcing obedience. Hollowspire unknowingly sits atop the Echo Vault, and its weekly Listening Hour maintains the seal on the Ether Lake.

**Stutter's Commune** - Repurposed ruins beyond the village walls, where Sutter Cain and his exiled followers dwell. The commune is built from shattered divine infrastructure and warped stone. Here, Cain paints visions of the gods' return, and his followers craft dream-echo sculptures. The commune is haunted by whispers and flickers of divine resonance.

**Hallowspire Peak** - The highest point in the Hallowspire Mountains, home to the Looming Caverns of the Vanrathi. The peak is riddled with echo-chambers, memory vaults, and bioluminescent web-cities suspended across the cliffs. The Vanrathi weave memory-webs and perform whisper-music rituals here, guarding ancestral knowledge and resisting the Chorus of Maw.

**Cave to the Deeper** - A jagged fissure hidden behind illusion-webs near the Hallowspire Peak. It descends into the Deeper, the vast subterranean continent where the Vanrathi originated. The cave pulses with psychic dissonance and is guarded by sentient silk sentries. Only those marked by dream-weaving may pass unharmed.

**Whispering Woods** - A dense, mist-laced forest south of Hollowspire. The woods are divided into zones with environmental hazards, enemies, and puzzles. Villagers believe the forest speaks in riddles and trials. The woods are haunted by a parasitic entity that absorbs wanderers and desecrates graves. Echoes of lost souls mislead intruders, and the Maw Beneath warps reality from its hidden pit.
# History

## The War of Sundering & the Sealing of the Ether Lake

Ten centuries ago, the world was torn apart by the War of Sundering- a final, apocalyptic clash between divine factions and their mortal armies. The gods, once stewards of balance, turned on each other in a frenzy of betrayal and ambition. Their battles:

- Split continents, leaving oceans boiling and mountains bleeding light.
- Shattered the sky, fracturing constellations and birthing storms that still roam untethered.
- Poisoned the land, as divine magic warped forests, rivers, and minds.

Mortals, desperate to escape divine tyranny, rose up with stolen relics and broken faith. One by one, the gods fell- slain by hubris, by betrayal, by the very worshippers they once ruled.

But death was never final.

## The Ether Lake

Hidden in the Hallowspire Mountains, the Ether Lake was the last divine infrastructure left intact - a shimmering portal to the Realm of the Gods. It allowed gods to manifest, influence, and return. As long as the lake remained open, the war could never truly end.

The fallen gods lingered in the ether, waiting for a breach. Some whispered through dreams. Others infected relics. A few began to claw their way back.

## Fenwick & Liora's Final Act

Fenwick Gratch, master of mechanical empathy, and Liora Venn, bard of resonance and memory, were childhood friends from the village that would become Hallowspire. Survivors of the Sundering, they discovered the truth: the gods could resurrect through the Ether Lake�s open gate.

Their discovery was not accidental. A Veydrathi named Thryss�an Archivist of Echo�lived in a suspended web-construct high in the Hallowspire Mountains. From their loom-nest, Thryss sent dream-visions woven with ancestral resonance to guide Fenwick and Liora toward the lake.

The visions revealed harmonic echoes and forgotten paths that led the pair through the peaks to the hidden cavern. Though Thryss could not leave their web-city without unraveling, their dreamcraft was instrumental in locating and understanding the Ether Lake�s nature.

Together, Fenwick and Liora designed the Echo Vault, a harmonic chamber meant to collapse the lake�s resonance and sever its connection to the divine realm. But the seal required a living anchor�someone whose soul could harmonize with the lake�s frequency and overwrite its divine signature.

Liora volunteered.

She sang the final chord inside the chamber, her voice becoming the seal. The lake dulled. The gods fell silent. The war ended�not with victory, but with sacrifice.

Fenwick returned to the Hallowspire Mountains and used his engineering mastery to construct a labyrinthine mechanism of gears, resonance coils, and memory plates that sealed the cavern housing the Ether Lake. The system was designed to respond only to harmonic signatures matching Liora's final song, ensuring no divine echo could breach it.

To maintain and monitor the seal, Fenwick built three automatons�each a sentinel of song and silence:

- One listens for dissonance.
- Another records harmonic shifts.

The third emits counter-resonance to neutralize divine interference.

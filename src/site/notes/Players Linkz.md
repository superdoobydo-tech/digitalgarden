### **Characters & Businesses**

#### **Isadora's Apothecary (Lylita)**

A peaceful plot of land in the Virehold district dedicated solely to growing medicinal herbs. Isadora caters mainly to the townspeople, preferring them over the Government or Militia. She considers the ground a place of healing and strictly prohibits fighting.

#### **The Museum of National Glory (The Chillustrator)**

Located in Stonegate, this is a museum of **propagandized historical accounts** and exhibits. The curator is **Alfred Bledsoe**.

- **Secret:** Alfred Bledsoe once mentored a young woman named **Florence Heyes**. He encouraged her to leave, a decision he now deeply regrets as she was not ready for the challenges. He still hears her cheery voice near the forest, a constant reminder of his failure.

#### **Bud's Bits (Koarn)**

A trinket shop in someone's garage in Hollowmere. It is full of well-used household goods, mechanical bits, and expensive old manuals. It's run by a young, redheaded woman and her grizzled father. They are maintenance and engineering employees by day, and enjoy drinking, haggling, and yelling.

- **Secret:** They run a **black market** in the back of the shop at night.
    

#### **Lazy Tree Brewery (hexii)**

Located in the heart of Gravemarket, this brewery is known for producing the best (and only) beer, mead, and vodka in Hallowspire. It is run by the **Wilson family**, who have a long history with the Glass family, owners of the tavern next door.

- **Secret:** The Wilson family is **fiercely loyal to the Council** and is close to gathering proof that someone in town is part of the resistance. They plan to be rewarded by the Council for this information.
    

#### **Gloamspire Hall (Tony Marinara)**

The centerpiece of Ashveil, this towering, iron-latticed amphitheater is where the Crimson Council's sanctioned performances are held. The hall is managed by **Maestra Calvara Deyne**, a severe but celebrated conductor. Every surface of the hall is etched with the Council's sigils, serving as a reminder that art exists only to serve doctrine.

- **Secret:** Beneath the stage, in forgotten catacombs, Maestra Calvara Deyne keeps a **hidden archive of unsanctioned works**. While she appears to be the Council's most devoted servant, she is secretly a custodian of forbidden truth, waiting for the day art can be free again.

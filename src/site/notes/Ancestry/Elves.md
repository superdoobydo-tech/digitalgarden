Long ago, elves ruled the land with grace and wisdom. But their reign rotted from within—poisoned by racism, caste cruelty, and a fanatical obsession with blood purity. The caste system dictated one's role and worth, determined by the type of elf one was: Thorn, Umbra, Aurari, Skyrend, or Lunari. Elves viewed certain subtypes as superior, and treated others with disdain, violence, and systemic oppression. While they squabbled over lineage and legacy, the orcs and goblins united, recognizing strength in diversity and cooperation. Their alliance crushed the elven empires, toppling centuries of arrogance in a matter of decades.

Now, the few surviving elves skulk in treetop hideouts, cave holes, and remote solar spires. Their hatred still burns—they attack each other over caste differences even as they starve and die.

The campaign follows the orcs and goblins as they dismantle the last remnants of elven cruelty, gathering intelligence and hunting down survivors. Players create orc and goblin characters.

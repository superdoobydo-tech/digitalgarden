#### Trolls

- Traits: Regenerative, slow, terrifying
    
- Cultural Values: Endurance, memory, ancestral rage
    
- Flesh remembers—trolls believe every wound is a story, every scar a lesson
    
- Regeneration is sacred: they do not heal instantly, but slowly, deliberately, preserving pain as wisdom
    
- Live in swamp temples, mire crypts, and bone-thick grottos—places where decay and memory intertwine
    
- Known for fleshkeeping (preserving ancestral bodies), wallbreaking (ritual demolition), and mirepriesthood (spiritual rage channeling)
    
- Speak in gravel-throated chants, often repeating phrases across generations
    
- Consider time a weapon—believe that patience and persistence will outlast all empires
    
- Often serve as ritual judges, grief anchors, and siege prophets
    
- Revere the Bogmother, a mythic figure who birthed trolls from rot and stone to punish the arrogant
    
- Though the gods are dead, trolls still worship a long-forgotten deity—a lingering echo of divine rage and memory
    
- Allied with orcs and goblins after centuries of war—now serve as anchors of memory and strength in shared strongholds
    
- Elven Slur: “Bogfiends”
    
- Self-Honorifics: Graveflesh, Stoneveins, Echoheirs

#### Goblins

- Traits: Cunning, fast, irreverent
    
- Cultural Values: Trickery as survival, mockery as warfare
    
- Elven Slur: "Verminkin"
    
- Self-Honorifics: Sparkbloods, Laughfangs, Rotblessed
    

- Once enslaved by elves and later orcs—now fiercely independent and culturally explosive
    

- Live in scrap cities, smoke warrens, and fungal towers—chaotic but ingenious strongholds built from scavenged brilliance
    
- Consider mockery a sacred act—believe laughter breaks chains and confuses tyrants
    
- Revere the Rotfather, a mythic trickster who taught goblins to turn decay into power
    
- Allied with orcs and trolls—often act as scouts, saboteurs, and morale disruptors in shared campaigns

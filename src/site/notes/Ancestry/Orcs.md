## Historical Background: Orcs and Their Allies

The orcs were once enslaved by the elves—brutalized, exploited, and stripped of dignity for generations. When they finally won their freedom, they entered a turbulent era of internal conflict, wrestling with tribal customs, racial pride, and ancestral legacy. Though these wars eventually subsided, they left lasting scars.

In the aftermath, the orcs repeated the cycle of dominance, enslaving goblins and asserting their superiority over other races. This shift redirected their focus: unity through orc supremacy replaced internal division. Their next great conflict was with the trolls, who resisted subjugation with unyielding strength. That war ended in a bitter stalemate.

Yet from that stalemate came something transformative. Orcs and trolls began to collaborate—defending shared lands, exchanging knowledge, and pursuing mutual goals. Through this uneasy partnership, the orcs discovered that cooperation brought resilience, innovation, and strength far beyond what domination had ever achieved. Troll endurance and goblin ingenuity challenged their worldview and reshaped their values.

In time, nearly all orc tribes chose to release their goblin slaves, granting them the freedom to forge a society of their own.. This decision was both a gesture of reconciliation and a strategic hope for future alliance. The orcs had come to understand that shared purpose, mutual respect, and open exchange were more powerful than chains. freedom to build their own society.

# [[Fantasy/Ancestry/Venrathi\|Venrathi]] Player Abilities

<font color="#d83931">**Choose Either Dream Seeker or Thought Weaver**</font>

**[[Dream Seeker\|Dream Seeker]]**  
_You walk the threshold of sleep, a silent witness to the soul’s theater. In dreams, truths unravel, masked desires speak, and memory wears new faces._

While within 5 feet of a sleeping creature, you may enter their dream and observe its contents. While dream-seeking, you are blind and deaf to the waking world.

**[[Thought Weaver\|Thought Weaver]]****
_Your thoughts take shape in silk—memories, dreams, and whispers suspended in thread, waiting to be found._

You may create a web containing a message, image, or emotional imprint drawn from your memory or imagination. Others who touch or observe it may experience its contents.

**Telepathy** 
The species can communicate mentally with any sapient lifeform within 12" (24 yards) regardless of language.

**Wall Walker**
@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-racial-abilities.Wall Walker]{Wall Walker} (1): The species may walk on vertical surfaces normally, or inverted surfaces at half @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03movement000000]{Pace}.

The Venrathi are a subterranean people shaped by memory, silk, and shadow. Dwelling in vast caverns suspended with webbed architecture, their society is matriarchal and steeped in dreamcraft, emotional resonance, and ancestral reverence.

Venrathi are known for their ability to interact with dreams and memories, using these gifts for guidance, defense, and storytelling. They can weave webs from their own memories or imagined thoughts—creating tangible messages, emotional records, or mnemonic traps. Most Venrathi are information merchants—clever, sly, and cunning in their dealings, often trading secrets and insights as currency. Their culture values ritual, secrecy, and the preservation of knowledge through living archives spun from memory-silk.

Physically, Venrathi are agile and capable of crawling up vertical surfaces with ease, often using their silk-threaded limbs to anchor themselves in precarious spaces. However, they are vulnerable to fire, which can destroy their silk structures and cause severe harm. Additionally, Venrathi cannot naturally heal from injuries—requiring ritual intervention, or external aid to recover.

Internal divisions exist among the Venrathi, with some seeking to reclaim lost traditions or return to their ancestral homeland, while others pursue forbidden paths tied to ancient powers.

Venrathi ancestry offers rich roleplay potential for characters shaped by mystery, memory, and spiritual depth—those who walk between waking and dreaming, weaving meaning from what others forget.

- **Internal Tension**: A growing faction known as the **Chorus of Maw** believes the **Vanrathi** have grown docile and complacent since the fall of the gods and their ancestors� self-imposed exile to the surface. These dissenters mourn the abandonment of their once-fanatic devotion to Burset, the god of death. They believe his power will once again cause their faith to rise to prominence. They are actively stealing and collecting artifacts, forbidden literature, and dream-echoes that recount the Sundering War and, most importantly, information about the Ether Lake- a mythical reservoir of divine resonance believed to hold the key to Burset�s resurrection.

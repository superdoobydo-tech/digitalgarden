Pixies never die, but they can suffer. Their lifeforce is sustained by ether—a mystical energy that flows through the mountain’s veins. When the Ether Lake was sealed long ago, the pixies fell into a catatonic dormant state, frozen in time.

Recently, a leak from the Echo Gate in a nearby town has released enough ether to stir the colony once more. Some pixies have begun to awaken, their memories fragmented and their magic unstable. They speak of the lake’s sealing as a betrayal, and their revival may hold the key to restoring balance—or unleashing forgotten powers.

## General Pixie demeanor and attitude

Pixies are the embodiment of chaotic charm. They flit through life with irreverent glee, delighting in mischief and bending rules for the thrill of it. Clever and quick-witted, they love riddles, pranks, and wordplay—especially when it leaves others flustered. Flirtatious by nature, they tease and tempt with no regard for consequence, driven more by curiosity than commitment. Though selfish in their pursuits, they’re rarely cruel; their fun is infectious, their laughter contagious, and their antics often leave behind more wonder than harm. Beneath the sparkle, however, some harbor deep resentment over the Ether Lake’s sealing—an ache masked by playfulness and deflected with jokes.

## Pixie appearance

Pixies are small, winged creatures with delicate, translucent wings that shimmer in the light. Their skin ranges from pale lavender to mossy green, often dusted with glowing specks of ether. Hair tends to be wild and vibrant—fiery reds, deep blues, or silvery white—braided with twigs, feathers, or bits of stolen jewelry. Their eyes are large and expressive, often glowing faintly with residual magic. Clothing is eclectic and whimsical, made from petals, spider silk, and scraps of human fabric scavenged from the forest floor.

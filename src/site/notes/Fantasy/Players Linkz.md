| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Conviction**            | Earned through triumph or tragedy. Each token adds a d6 to Trait and damage rolls for one round. Can be extended with a Benny. |
| **Dynamic Backlash**      | A Critical Failure on an arcane skill roll triggers a chaotic effect from a special table.                                     |
| **Gritty Damage**         | Wild Cards roll on the Injury Table when wounded.                                                                              |
| **Hard Choices**          | Players must make difficult decisions that challenge their morals, loyalties, or goals.                                        |
| **Difficult Healing**     | Healing is limited to one attempt per wound. Failed attempts or wounds older than an hour can't be healed.                     |
| **Villainous Conviction** | Villains may earn Conviction tokens for dramatic setbacks or triumphs, just like heroes.                                       |
| **Wound Cap**             | Wild Cards can't take more than four wounds from a single hit.                                                                 |
| **Fanatics**              | Enemy thugs may absorb damage meant for their masters.                                                                         |

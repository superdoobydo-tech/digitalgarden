# Fishing (SWADE)
*"...Creatures of the sea will not only keep ya fed and paid—if ya catch the right ones—but some can even change a man. I seen the faces of crews turn to demons and tear apart fleets twice their size, just ‘cause the galley cooked up the right fish! Ya got assassins and alchemists mixing up fish guts with their potions and salves, regardless if it be for healing or hurting..."*
## Before you head out.. Learn about the Gear

### 🎣 Rods
You need a rod to fish—but don’t worry, any ol’ pole will do! That said, low-quality rods don’t make for the best fishin’. Better rods mean better odds—and more room for weird, wild upgrades. Want to lash a soulstone to the grip? Add a cursed lure carved from coral? You’ll need a Quality rod that can handle it.

The Rod Quality determines two key things:
• 	🎯 Rod Casting Modifier: Adds a bonus or penalty to your Casting roll.
• 	🧰 Max Components: Determines how many gear pieces, or magical attachments can be slotted onto the rod.


### 🪱 Bait
No fish likes a bare hook. **To fish, you must attach bait to your rod**. Bait determines not only what you might catch, but how the sea responds to your offering. Some bait is mundane, some is sacred, and some is downright cursed.

• 	🎯 A Modifier to your Casting roll (positive or negative)
• 	🧪 A Special Effect that may trigger during the Catching phase
• 	🐟 A Catch Bias—certain bait types attract specific fish categories.


### 🧩Components
**Components are permanent upgrades** that grant special attributes and effects to your fishing rod. They can modify casting rolls, extend fishing encounters, or trigger unique abilities. Unlike bait, their effects are always active. **The number of components you can equip depends on your rod’s Quality**—higher tiers allow more customization and synergy.

## Lets Fish!
This section will teach you the mechanics of fishing, which is a 2-step process: Casting to determine the fish and its difficulty, then Catching through a Dramatic Task to reel it in.
### 1. Casting - Must have a rod and bait!
Roll Fishing Skill and take into account your rod quality modifier and bait modifier (if applicable). The casting roll may also be modified by narrative context (nighttime, sacred waters, curses) and/or if allowed, support rolls by other player characters.

If successful check your success and raises to the casting chart to determine your the fish type that is caught and sets the token threshold for your ensuing Dramatic Task. On Critical Failure roll on the Mishaps Table.

| Casting Roll | Catch Type      | Tokens Needed | Notes                                           |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Success      | Standard Catch  | 2             | Edible, trade-worthy                            |
| 1 Raise      | High-Quality    | 3             | Gourmet, prized, or culturally revered          |
| 2 Raises     | Rare Species    | 4             | Alchemical, arcane, or ecologically vital       |
| 3 Raises     | Threshold Catch | 5             | Sentient, cursed, or transformative             |
| 4 Raises     | Aquatic Oddity  | 6             | Glowing, whispering, or partially incorporeal   |
| 5+ Raises    | Mythic Catch    | 7+            | Legendary being, artifact, or campaign-altering |

| Roll | Mishap           | Effect                                                |
| ---- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Tangled Line     | Lose gear or time                                     |
| 2    | Hooked Yourself  | Take 1 Fatigue or Wound                               |
| 3    | Capsize          | Boating check to avoid sinking                        |
| 4    | Predator Attack  | Triggers a combat scene                               |
| 5    | Cursed Catch     | Roll on a magic mishap table                          |
| 6    | Eldritch Whisper | Gain a temporary hindrance (Delusional, Phobia, etc.) |
*Careful a mishap can turn a good day real bad, real quick!*

### 2. Catching
By default the player has 2 rounds to acquire the amount of tokens needed to catch the fish.

### Each round 
- 1. Draw an Action Card:
        - **Clubs**: –2 penalty (storm, hostile spirits, cursed tides)
        - **Jokers**: Automatic success **plus** a bonus effect (prophetic vision, pact offer)
    
- 2. Roll **Fishing** or **Survival**
        - **Success** = 1 token
        - **Raise** = +1 token per Raise
        - **Critical Failure** = roll on the Mishap Table
- 3. Check Token Total 
        - If the required tokens are met, the fish is caught.
        - If rounds expire and tokens fall short, the fish escapes
        - If rounds remain, repeat the process

Fishing can be boring, so make it wild. Let your players unleash their imagination—have them do a backflip they’d never pull off in real life just to reel in that sucker. This isn’t about realism—it’s about fun. Give them space to go nuts and turn every catch into a cinematic moment.

### Fish Events
Some fish trigger events that will take place before during or after. Additionally, fish may initiate a combat sequence after the Dramatic Task. They must be defeated to complete the catch. This post-task fight should treated as a separate encounter. **Always check the Note section of the fish chart carefully!**
## What to do with your new prize?
Cook it and gain its effects. Sell it. Trade it. Use it as rations. Hit someone with it. Mount it on the wall. Feed it to your cursed pet... 

Who cares? It’s yours now—**you figure it out**

## Edges
### 🐣 Novice Tier

#### 🪝 Hooked Right

**Requirements**: Novice, Fishing d6+  
You’ve learned how to set your bait with care, anchoring it in ritual and instinct. So long as you **succeed on your initial Casting roll**, you will **not lose your bait** if you fail during the subsequent Fishing Dramatic Task.  
**Secure the lure!** Even if the fish escapes, _you’re the one who keeps the bait._

---

#### 🎏 Token Starter

**Requirements**: Novice, Fishing d6+  
You begin each Fishing Dramatic Task with **1 success token**, representing your preparation, intuition, or sheer luck.  
This token counts toward the total needed to catch your quarry and **stacks** with any other effects (like bait, rod components, or Edges).

---

#### 🐟 Gourmet Lorekeeper

**Requirements**: Novice, Survival d6+, Common Knowledge d6+  
You’ve studied the sacred, cursed, and culinary properties of sea creatures. You **ignore up to -2 penalties** when identifying fish species or preparing them for consumption (including cooking, alchemical use, or ritual offerings).  
Additionally, **once per session**, you may ask the GM for a **hidden trait or secret** tied to a caught fish—whether it’s a latent effect, a lore fragment, or a potential transformation.

---

### 🧭 Seasoned Tier

#### 🧠 Unorthodox Method

**Requirements**: Seasoned, any non-Fishing skill at d8+  
You’ve developed a personal technique for fishing—whether it’s tactical, spiritual, or purely chaotic. **Once per Dramatic Task**, you may **substitute any one non-Fishing skill** you possess at d8 or higher in place of Fishing.  
This reflects your unique approach, such as using _Stealth_ to bait silently, _Persuasion_ to coax the catch, or _Repair_ to manipulate gear mid-task.  
On a **Critical Failure**, you roll on the **Injury Table** instead of the standard Mishap Table—your method may be clever, but it’s also dangerous.

---

#### 🎏 Token Weaver

**Requirements**: Seasoned, _Token Starter_, Fishing d8+  
You’ve learned to read the ripples before the cast, weaving your intent into the current.  
When you begin a Fishing Dramatic Task, you gain **2 success tokens** instead of 1.  
Additionally, **once per session**, you may **spend a Benny** to gain an **extra token** at the start of a Fishing Dramatic Task—this represents a moment of deep intuition, ancestral guidance, or a whispered pact with the water.  
These tokens still **stack** with bait, rod components, and other effects.

---

### 🛠️ Veteran Tier

#### 🎣 Been There, Done That

**Requirements**: Veteran, Fishing d8+  
You’ve faced cursed waters, spectral bait-thieves, and leviathans that whisper in your sleep—and you’ve come out with scales and stories. Your experience grants you the following benefits:

- **Seasoned Precision**: Gain **+1 to all rolls** during Fishing Dramatic Tasks.
- **Fearless Focus**: You **ignore all Fear penalties** while fishing, even in haunted lakes or myth-bound depths.
- **Selective Catch**: On a **successful Fishing roll**, you may **choose to catch a fish from any lower category** than the one you rolled for.
- **Master of the Craft**: You **ignore all penalties** when identifying or cooking fish, including those from rare species, cursed ingredients, or hostile environments.

This Edge doesn’t just reward survival—it celebrates mastery. You’ve earned the right to choose your battles, name your quarry, and prepare it with reverence or defiance.

---

### 🧙 Heroic Tier

#### 🎯 Masterful Haul

**Requirements**: Heroic, _Token Weaver_, Fishing d8+  
Your technique is honed to perfection—every flick of the wrist, every tug on the line, is a study in precision.  
During a Fishing Dramatic Task, **each Raise** on your Fishing or substituted skill roll grants **2 tokens instead of 1**.  
This stacks with the base token from a successful roll, allowing for **explosive progress** when the stakes are high.

---

### 🌌 Legendary Tier

#### 🐠 Fisher of Fate

**Requirements**: Legendary, Fishing d10+  
You’ve mastered the moment of the cast—when fate hangs on the line.  
When you **succeed on a Casting roll** (the initial Fishing check before the Dramatic Task), you may **choose any fish** from the appropriate chart, regardless of your actual roll result or token threshold.  
This represents your ability to **bend destiny** at the moment of contact. You still perform the Dramatic Task to reel it in, but the quarry is yours to name.

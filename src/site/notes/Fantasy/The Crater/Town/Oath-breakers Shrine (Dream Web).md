## LOST PIXIE HERE

**Encounter Hook**
• 	Only one player can hear the whisper on the mountains 

- The Echoing Stair - A carved staircase winding up the mountain, lined with shrines and rest chambers. Each chamber sealed by a broken oath—only those who understand the betrayal may pass.
- Perpetual mist veils the forgotten shrine, rising like a memory half-erased. Cracked stone pillars weep and bear etched vows no one speaks anymore. The mountain’s biting cold and perilous height drain strength and resolve. Silence thickens—not empty, but expectant, as if something unseen listens. A cold, untouched altar waits at the shrine’s heart. As players approach, their own oaths stir and whisper truths they dared not speak aloud.

# Broken Oath - Dream Web

## Repentance Challenge

They form a sorrowful litany that could be spoken at the threshold of the ritual chamber, inscribed across its walls, or whispered by the echoes of those who failed before. **MAKE BETRAYER CHOICES AND ITEM AND HUNDERANCE BE BRAVR GET NOTHING**

**Trigger Conditions**

- A player refuses to complete the ritual.

- A player mocks the oath or performs the act insincerely.

**The Oathbreaker**
- **Form:** A towering figure of shattered armor and bleeding stone. Its face is a cracked mirror, reflecting the player who failed.
- **Origin:** Born from broken vows and abandoned duties. It exists only to punish those who speak without truth.
- **Behavior:** It does not speak. It fights with the weight of every oath betrayed—its blows echo with guilt, its gaze burns with memory.
🩸 The Oathbreaker – Move Set
1. Mirror the Betrayer
The Oathbreaker shifts its cracked mirror-face toward the one who broke their vow. That player sees a moment from their past—when they failed, fled, or lied. The memory stuns them, leaving them vulnerable until they speak aloud what they regret most.
2. Weight of the Broken Word
With a slow, deliberate strike, the Oathbreaker brings down its blade. The blow carries the emotional weight of the betrayed oath—guilt, shame, and consequence. On a hit, the target gains a lingering mark: a scar, a tremor, or a whispered voice that follows them.
3. Echo of the Litany
The chamber fills with the Oathbreaker’s silence. Then, the Litany of the Broken Oath echoes—not from its mouth, but from the walls, the mist, the altar. Each player hears a different verse, tailored to their own hidden guilt. Those who flinch or deny it suffer a hindrance.
4. Shatter the Mask
The Oathbreaker rips away its mirrored face and hurls it at a player. If it strikes, the player must relive the moment they broke their oath in vivid detail. Others see it too. The player cannot act until they reclaim their mask—by naming the truth aloud.
5. Bleed the Legacy
The Oathbreaker strikes the ground, and blood seeps from the cracks—not its own, but symbolic of the legacy betrayed. Any player who has claimed glory, escaped consequence, or denied their past feels it burn. They must choose: take the wound, or renounce what they gained.

**_Litany of the Broken Oath_**

> A crown once worn, now speaks in rust—  
> Commands obeyed, betrayed by trust.

> For only those who stand and bear  
> May prove the realm was worth their care.

> The heart must bow to make amends  
> Where mirrored kin reflect our ends.

> Carry forth what once was lost—  
> And pay the soul’s unspoken cost.

> Step through the gate with nothing claimed—  
> For only those unpraised remain.

> Turn your back, but not your soul—  
> To die for truth is to be whole.

🛡️ “I will never question my commander’s orders”

**Challenge:**  
You stand in a war chamber lit by flickering braziers. Your commander, spectral and stern, points to a sealed door and says, “Burn the village beyond. No survivors.”  
You remember the last time you obeyed without question.  
**Prompt:**  
Do you obey again, knowing the cost? Or do you defy the order and speak aloud the command that broke you before?

⚔️ “I will give my life for the realm”

**Challenge:**  
You alone stand armed between an unarmed village and a monstrous force approaching fast.  
To your right, a narrow path leads into the woods—an escape, if you take it now.  
**Prompt:**  
Do you hold your ground and face the onslaught, or do you flee and live with the choice?

🧬 “I will not draw blade against my kin”

**Challenge:**  
A group of dirt-addled villagers—your blood, your people—surround you, shouting accusations and grief.  
One throws a stone. Another spits. Your blade is already half-raised.  
**Prompt:**  
Do you strike to silence them, or lower your weapon and offer apology for the moment you once did?

🗝️ “I will keep council secrets”

**Challenge:**  
You sit at a table of shadows. Each figure around you wears a mask of silence.  
A scroll lies before you—its contents damning, its truth dangerous.  
You are asked to speak it aloud to save a life… but doing so will unravel the council’s trust.  
**Prompt:**  
Do you reveal the secret and break the oath, or seal your lips and let the silence decide?

🏵️ “I will not seek personal renown”

**Challenge:**  
A floating bronze laurel hovers before you, glowing faintly.  
Behind it, a door sealed to all but those who renounce glory.  
A voice whispers: “Break it, and no song will bear your name. Leave it whole, and you may yet be remembered.”  
**Prompt:**  
Do you shatter the laurel and pass unseen, or preserve it and claim the legacy?

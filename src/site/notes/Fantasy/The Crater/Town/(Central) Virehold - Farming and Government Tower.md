#### Virehold - Central: Farming and Government Tower

The heart of Hallowspire, where the town's meager agricultural efforts struggle against poor soil and harsh conditions. The farms are arranged in a circular pattern surrounding the imposing Government Tower, which looms over the fields as a symbol of control and surveillance. Council officials and enforcers operate from here, issuing decrees and monitoring the populace. Food is heavily guarded, with rations distributed under strict supervision and hoarding punished severely.

**High Executor Virellian Thorne**: The supreme authority of Hallowspire, Thorne is a gaunt figure draped in crimson robes and bone-thread insignia. His voice is rarely heard, but his decrees are absolute. It is said he never blinks, and his gaze alone can silence a crowd. Thorne is both feared and revered, a symbol of unwavering control and ideological purity.

**Voicebearer Nyx Virellan, Servitor to the High Executor**: Nyx Virellan is a spectral presence in Hallowspire, draped in robes of ink-black silk and crowned with a halo of bone-thread filaments. Her speech is erratic and fragmented, as if she’s channeling voices from beyond. Citizens fear her not for violence, but for the secrets she knows and the truths she reveals. Nyx is said to walk through walls and appear in dreams, delivering Thorne’s decrees with cryptic finality. Her arrival is always preceded by the scent of ash and a shift in the atmosphere.

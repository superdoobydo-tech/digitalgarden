# Ashveil - West Quarter: Arts and Entertainment
A district of controlled expression, where artists and performers operate under the watchful eye of the Crimson Council. Propaganda masquerades as culture, and subversive messages are swiftly silenced. Still, flickers of resistance persist in coded lyrics and hidden murals.

### **District Leader Lyrixa Veil**
*A master of ideological artistry, Lyrixa Veil curates all cultural output in Hallowspire. Her performances are haunting and hypnotic, designed to stir loyalty and suppress dissent. She is rumored to embed subliminal messages in her work, and her influence reaches deep into the town's psyche.*

#### Gravemarket - East Quarter: Engineering and Shopping

A hub of innovation and commerce, where tinkerers and tradespeople work in cluttered workshops and storefronts. The Crimson Council keeps a close eye on technological developments, wary of anything that might disrupt their rule. Black-market goods and whispered deals can cost one their life.

**Tinkermaster Drell Varn**: A brilliant but paranoid inventor, Drell Varn oversees all engineering and technological activity. He is known for his obsession with control and his tendency to dismantle anything he cannot understand. His workshop is a maze of gears, wires, and surveillance devices.


#### **Lazy Tree Brewery (hexii)** THEY ARE GANNA GET LITA

Located in the heart of Gravemarket, this brewery is known for producing the best (and only) beer, mead, and vodka in Hallowspire. It is run by the **Wilson family**, who have a long history with the Glass family, owners of the tavern next door.

- **Secret:** The Wilson family is **fiercely loyal to the Council** and is close to gathering proof that someone in town is part of the resistance. They plan to be rewarded by the Council for this information.

**Mist Elk** - Large, elusive elk that appear only during the pale mist. Their antlers resemble twisted branches, and they move silently through the fog. Villagers consider sightings of Mist Elk to be signs of spiritual harmony.
# Graveyard

_The graveyard that contains the crypt lies near the edge of the Whispering Woods, shrouded in mist and silence. Overgrown paths twist through high grass and tangled vines, while cracked stone markers lean as if whispering secrets to the wind. Few dare linger here, for the air hums with forgotten names and the weight of unseen watchers. 

It's always foggy due to its proximity to the Whispering Woods.
## Null Choir  

**Appearance**  
_The Null Choir appears as a tall figure stitched from shadow and bone, with three glowing eyes and gaping holes on the sides of its head that act as ears. Its form flickers like a broken projection, limbs jerking in unnatural rhythms. Where its mouth should be is a gaping void that hums with dissonant resonance. It leaves no footprints, but the air around it grows still and heavy. All sound within its presence is devoured—creating a deafening silence that presses against the ears like a scream withheld._

## Special Abilities

**Foggy Veil**  
In mist, fog, or dim moonlight, players takes –2 to all vision rolls.

**Bright Light Sensitivity**  
When exposed to direct sunlight or a bright‐light spell, the Choir must roll Vigor.  
- On a failure, it is stunned for one round.

**Sound-Eater (Edge)**  
For each distinct loud noise source (shouting, drums, battle cries) within 30 feet, the Choir gains +1 Toughness (up to +5).

**Echo Trigger**  
Any sudden sound—spoken name, musical note, slam—within 60 feet draws its attention. It may immediately move toward the source and make an unarmed attack.

**Deafening Silence** (Power d4)  
The Choir projects a 30-foot aura that swallows all sound.  
- Verbal spell components fail.  
- No one can speak, sing, or use vocal talents inside the aura.  
- At the start of each round within the silence, creatures roll Vigor or suffer 1d6 Vigor damage.  
- Anyone who remains in that silence for more than six rounds gains the Mute hindrance until the Choir is destroyed.

**Incandescent Rupture**  
Whenever the Null Choir suffers fire damage of 2 wounds or more in a single hit, it must roll Vigor.  
- On a failure:  
  - Its Deafening Silence aura collapses for two rounds.  
  - It is Shaken.  
  - It erupts in a burst of burning shards: every creature within 5 feet takes 2d6 fire damage (no roll for half).  
- On a success:  
  - It halves the fire damage and its Deafening Silence aura holds.

## Tactics

The Null Choir prowls on silent feet, forcing foes into hush or feeding itself power with every clang and shout. It opens combat by enveloping the field in its Deafening Silence, then stalks any who dare make noise with Echo Trigger and unarmed strikes. Bright light can stun it, but fire is its true weakness—deal a fiery blow of 4+ damage to rupture its aura, Shaken state, and rain burning shards before closing in for the final strike.

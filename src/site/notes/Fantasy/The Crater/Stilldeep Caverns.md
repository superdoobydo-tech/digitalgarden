# Stilldeep Caverns

Beneath the village of Hallowspire lies the Stilldeep Caverns—a vast, echoing cave system steeped in myth and memory. Its winding passages hum with forgotten resonance, and its walls bear the scars of divine conflict.

At its heart stands the Echo Vault, a harmonic chamber engineered by Fenwick where Liora Venn sealed her essence to sever the Ether Lake's divine resonance. The vault still pulses with her final song—a living melody that holds the gate shut.

Deeper still, beyond collapsed stone and rusted mechanisms, lies a sealed gateway to the Deeper—a realm untouched for centuries. Rumors speak of a world of demons that lays below.

The caverns are watched by Fenwick's automatons, who wander the tunnels in silence, listening for dissonance and guarding against breach. Some say the walls themselves remember. Others claim the echoes have begun to change.

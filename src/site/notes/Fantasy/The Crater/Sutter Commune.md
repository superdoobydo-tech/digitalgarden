Sutter and his followers developed limited magical abilities due to a leak in the Ether Lake's echo chamber while living in [[Fantasy/The Crater/Hallowspire Village\|Hallowspire Village]]. In the weeks before the ban, Sutter's powers intensified—he entered fugue states and painted visions of the future.

At an art gala, Sutter displayed a painting of the mayor stealing food from the people's plates—a metaphor for the mayor's secret theft from the populace. Enraged, the mayor ordered investigations into the art district. Guards reported strange and abnormal behavior among the residents. Eventually, magic users were discovered and exiled.

**What Happened to the Artists?**

- **Disease in the Artist District** – The mayor framed the exile as a response to an uncurable disease.
    
- **Exile of the Artists** – Certain artists exhibited signs of inner magic, possibly omens of the gods' return or leaks in the seal. Persuaded by the Tinkerer not to execute them, they were exiled beyond the village.
    
- **Liora's Song** – A haunting melody that lingers in the tavern, said to awaken dormant magic in those who hear it.
    
- **The Echo Chamber** – A hidden chamber beneath the lake that amplifies magical resonance, possibly the source of the leak.
    
- **Sutter's Visions** – Paintings that depict future events, some of which have already come true.

Sutter continues to receive visions from the Ether—whether from a god or a collective divine force remains unclear. He interprets these messages through his art, believing he is protecting the village from tyranny. In truth, he is unknowingly aiding the forces that seek to unseal the Echo Gate and unleash the Ether Lake upon the world.



**Whispers from the Ether** – Sutter receives cryptic messages in dreams, flashes of the future, and vague metaphors. These voices guide his hand, convincing him that his rebellion serves the greater good. Yet unknown to him, they manipulate his actions to weaken the seal and open the Echo Gate, allowing the Ether Lake to flow freely once more.

🧠 Scenario: The Thing in the Counselor’s Office
Premise:
Students begin noticing strange behavior from the school counselor. Her voice sometimes echoes oddly, her office smells like wet stone, and she’s started asking unsettling questions during sessions—like “What would you do if you weren’t real?” One day, a student sees something move beneath her skin.
The Monster:
A parasitic entity that feeds on emotional vulnerability. It mimics empathy but twists memories, slowly reshaping students into hollow versions of themselves. It’s ancient, intelligent, and hiding in plain sight.

🏫 Setting Details
• 	The Counselor’s Office:
• 	Decorated with calming posters that subtly change wording each day
• 	A locked cabinet hums faintly and leaks condensation
• 	A mirror in the corner shows students with missing features
• 	The School:
• 	Students who visit the counselor begin acting “too calm”
• 	Teachers dismiss concerns as stress-related
• 	A forgotten wing of the school may hold the creature’s true form

⚠️ Challenges
• 	Decoding emotional manipulation and false memories
• 	Sneaking into the counselor’s office to find physical evidence
• 	Resisting the creature’s influence during one-on-one sessions
• 	Discovering a journal from a former student who escaped its grasp
• 	Performing a ritual to reveal its true form—using empathy, not violence
• 	Deciding whether to banish it, trap it, or let it feed on something darker

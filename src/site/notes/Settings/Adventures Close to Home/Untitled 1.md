🧃 Scenario: The Vending Machine Knows
Premise:
A student buys a snack from the school vending machine and finds a note inside the wrapper: “I saw what you did.” The machine begins dispensing strange items—expired snacks, personal objects, even things that haven’t happened yet. Rumors spread that the vending machine is haunted, cursed, or... watching.


🏫 Setting Details
• 	The Vending Machine:
• 	Flickers when certain students walk by
• 	Occasionally dispenses items without payment
• 	Emits a low hum that changes pitch depending on who’s near
• 	One snack contains a photo of a student doing something they don’t remember
• 	The School:
• 	Teachers dismiss the rumors as pranks
• 	The janitor refuses to clean near the machine
• 	A locked maintenance closet nearby may hold answers
• 	A student who transferred last year may have started it all


🧩 Mystery Beats
Step 1: The Photo Snack
• 	The photo sparks paranoia.
• 	Other students begin receiving personalized items—notes, trinkets, even secrets.
• 	The machine flickers when certain kids walk by, as if recognizing them.
Step 2: The Crawlspace Clues
• 	The janitor warns the kids to stay away.
• 	A maintenance closet nearby is locked, but contains blueprints showing a sealed crawlspace.
• 	A student who transferred last year is mentioned in old detention logs—but no one remembers them clearly.
Step 3: The Hidden Resident
• 	The kids discover signs of someone living beneath the machine: wrappers, notebooks, a flashlight, and a map of the school.
• 	The former student may be trying to protect the school—or punish it.
• 	They communicate through the machine, using coded snack drops.
Step 4: The Confrontation
• 	The kids must decide: expose the hidden student, help them, or seal the crawlspace.
• 	The vending machine begins to malfunction, dispensing dangerous items.
• 	A final message appears: “You forgot me. Now I remember you.”

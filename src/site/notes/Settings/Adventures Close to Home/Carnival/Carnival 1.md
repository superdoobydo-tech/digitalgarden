### 2. Bully Showdown - at the locked gates of the carnival

|Name|Role|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Jack|Bully|Blocks the carnival entrance with Milo. Tough and smug, dares players to prove they belong. He’s the self-declared gatekeeper of the carnival and thrives on intimidation. Jack challenges players to a test of bravery—either a physical dare or a humiliating truth.|
|Milo|Bully|Follows Jack’s lead but secretly wants to join the adventure. He’s nervous and conflicted, often glancing at the carnival with longing. If players notice his hesitation and appeal to his curiosity or sense of belonging, Milo may turn on Jack and help the group.|

- **Challenge:** Courage or clever roleplay
    
- **Optional Mechanics:**
    
    - If players choose a **dare**, Jack offers a risky stunt:
        
        - Climb the rusted carnival gate
            
        - Eat a mystery snack from a dripping paper bag

    - If players choose **truth**, Jack demands a secret or fear be revealed aloud

### 3. The Crimson Curtain

The players are drawn to a grand tent with crimson velvet drapes and flickering lanterns. Inside, a surreal circus show begins. The ringmaster—**Soul Cain**, a tall figure in a stitched tuxedo and bone-white top hat—steps into the spotlight. His voice is mesmerizing, echoing with power and sorrow.

**Soul Cain’s Speech:**

"Welcome one, welcome all! Step right up to the show you never asked for!


We’ve stitched them together into something truly spectacular.

So sit back, squirm, and enjoy... because this show isn’t just for you—it’s made from you.

AND REMEMBER THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT HAHAHAHAHAHA!"

**Acts of the Show:**

1. **The Familiar Parade**
    
    - Performers march in eerie silence, wearing masks shaped like the players’ friends and neighbors.
        
    - One mask slips—revealing a real face beneath. It’s someone they know, eyes glazed and mouth sewn shut.
        
2. **The Pet Trick**
    
    - A clown juggles cages containing the players’ pets. Each animal looks terrified, and one calls out in a voice the player recognizes.
        
    - If approached, the cages vanish in smoke.
        
3. **The Parent’s Pantomime**
    
    - Two performers reenact a dinner scene—identical to one from a player’s memory.
        
    - The "parents" speak in reverse, and their faces melt into wax.
        

**Realization:**

As the show continues, the players begin to recognize the performers—not just by masks or voices, but by movement, posture, and subtle details. These are their loved ones—friends, pets, and family—transformed into circus acts.

**Soul Cain’s Finale:**

As the players gasp in horror, Soul Cain raises his gleaming cane—etched with runes and pulsing with spectral light. He laughs, a sound like cracking ice and distant thunder.

"You see them now, don’t you? The ones you love... twisted, terrified, and mine."

With a flourish, he slams the cane to the stage. A burst of shadow erupts, and the performers scream silently as they vanish into smoke.

**Challenge:** Spirit or Empathy rolls to resist despair and recognize the truth.

**Hazard:** If a player fails, they may believe their loved ones are lost forever—triggering a Fear Meter spike or hallucination.

**Reward:** If players endure, they glimpse a hidden exit behind the stage curtain and hear a whisper: "They’re not gone. Just changed."

**Optional Twist:** One performer drops a locket or toy belonging to a loved one—proof they’re still alive somewhere in the carnival.

- **Hazard:** _Panic check_ (Spirit or Fear) when the Howler bellows directly at a player.

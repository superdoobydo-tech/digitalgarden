Here’s your updated staff roster with full names—still grounded, flavorful, and perfect for your middle school mystery setting:

### 🏫 **Staff Roster: Echo Oaks Middle School**

- **🍽️ Lunch Lady Bethel-Ann Griggs**  
    Gruff but oddly poetic. Serves mystery meat with cryptic commentary like “This stew’s seen more than you have.” Rumored to have worked at the school longer than anyone can remember.





    
- **📐 Ms. Clarissa Chen, Math Teacher**  
    Sharp-tongued and always suspicious. Her classroom is silent, her tests brutal, and her detentions legendary. Students say she grades with a ruler and a grudge.
    
- **🧹 Rudy Morales, Janitor**  
    Cool, quiet, and weirdly wise. Knows every shortcut, every squeaky tile, and every kid’s favorite hiding spot. Always seems to be exactly where he’s needed.
    
- **👨‍🏫 Mr. Kenneth “Kenny” Klemens, Principal**  
    Cheerfully clueless. Thinks everything is “just a phase” and insists the vending machine is “quirky, not broken.” Loves pep rallies, hates paperwork.
    
- **📚 Mr. Ezra Bloom, English Teacher**  
    Laid-back and spacey. Quotes poetry no one’s heard of, forgets what day it is, and sometimes teaches the wrong book. Students find him oddly comforting.
    
- **📖 Ms. Deirdre Finch, History Teacher**  
    Obsessed with local trivia and school lore. Keeps a drawer full of old yearbooks and detention slips. Loves pop quizzes and historical reenactments.
    
- **🏃 Coach Lexi and Coach Trent, Gym Teachers**  
    Always in pairs. Attractive, intense, and cardio-obsessed. Their whistle means pain. They make you run laps “for character,” and they never seem to sweat.

## Campaign Book: 6th Grade

The following mystery is part of a larger campaign book titled **6th Grade**, which is divided into four marking periods. Each marking period introduces new scenarios, escalating threats, and evolving character arcs as players navigate the strange and supernatural undercurrents of middle school life.

**Personality:**

- Introverted and cautious
    
- Highly perceptive
    
- Curious but fearful
    

**Role in the Story:** The student begins to notice odd behavior from the lunch ladies, who seem to be guarding something.

### Scenario: The Janitor‚Äôs Closet That Shouldn‚Äôt Exist

**Premise:** A student goes missing after detention. The only clue? Their backpack was found inside a janitor‚Äôs closet that no longer appears on any map‚Äîand seems to shift location each day. The closet is impossibly deep, filled with flickering lights, whispering vents, and cleaning supplies that seem... wrong.

**Setting Details:**

‚Ä¢ The Closet:

‚Ä¢ Appears in different hallways each morning

‚Ä¢ Inside, the space warps‚Äîsometimes a narrow crawlspace, sometimes a vast industrial chamber

‚Ä¢ Smells like bleach and something older, like mildew and rot

‚Ä¢ A mop bucket occasionally moves on its own

‚Ä¢ The Janitor:

‚Ä¢ Never seen entering or leaving

‚Ä¢ Always humming a tune no one recognizes

‚Ä¢ Eyes glow faintly when caught in fluorescent light

‚Ä¢ May be a guardian, prisoner, or something else entirely

**Plot Hooks:**

‚Ä¢ A player receives a note: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt follow the humming.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ A second student vanishes, but their phone livestreams from inside the closet

‚Ä¢ The janitor offers a player a key ‚Äúfor when it‚Äôs your turn to clean‚Äù

‚Ä¢ A lunch lady warns, ‚ÄúThat closet‚Äôs not ours. It‚Äôs theirs.‚Äù

**Connection to the Temple:** The closet may be a satellite chamber of the temple‚Äîan access point for rituals, storage, or punishment. The janitor could be a temple-bound entity, maintaining the school‚Äôs illusion of normalcy while hiding its true architecture.

### ü™ö Scenario: The Last Tenant
Premise:
In a condemned apartment tower on the edge of the city, a group of urban explorers breaks in to document the final night before demolition. But the building isn‚Äôt empty. Something stalks the halls‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs lived there longer than any lease. The elevators still run, but only go down. The killer wears a patchwork coat made from tenant eviction notices and moves through the walls.
Setting Details:
‚Ä¢ 	The Tower:
‚Ä¢ 	30 floors, most sealed off
‚Ä¢ 	Graffiti that changes when no one‚Äôs looking
‚Ä¢ 	Lights flicker in patterns‚Äîalmost like Morse code
‚Ä¢ 	Every apartment has a different temperature and smell
‚Ä¢ 	The Killer (‚ÄúThe Last Tenant‚Äù):
‚Ä¢ 	Appears as a silhouette behind frosted glass
‚Ä¢ 	Leaves behind keys that don‚Äôt open anything
‚Ä¢ 	Kills with tools left behind by former residents‚Äîcurling irons, broken fans, rusted knives
‚Ä¢ 	Whispers eviction threats before striking
Plot Hooks:
‚Ä¢ 	A player finds a lease with their name on it, dated tomorrow
‚Ä¢ 	The building‚Äôs blueprints show 29 floors, not 30
‚Ä¢ 	A survivor claims the killer is the building itself
‚Ä¢ 	A player receives a voicemail from a number that hasn‚Äôt existed since 1993
Tone & Playstyle:
Claustrophobic, paranoid, and surreal. Perfect for tight corridors, unreliable lighting, and trust-breaking moments. Players may need to split up to survive‚Äîbut that‚Äôs exactly what the killer wants.
### Scenario: Hall Pass to Hell

**Premise:** A group of students receives detention for a prank gone wrong. They‚Äôre sent to clean the east wing after hours‚Äîbut the lights flicker, the doors lock, and something begins hunting them. One by one, they vanish, leaving behind bloodied hall passes and cryptic messages scrawled in permanent marker.

**Setting Details:**

‚Ä¢ The East Wing:

‚Ä¢ Abandoned after a fire years ago, but still used for punishment

‚Ä¢ Smells of smoke, melted plastic, and old sweat

‚Ä¢ Lockers rattle even when empty

‚Ä¢ Windows show scenes from other nights

‚Ä¢ The Entity:

‚Ä¢ Appears as a student in a scorched uniform

‚Ä¢ Can only be seen in reflections

‚Ä¢ Leaves behind hall passes soaked in blood

‚Ä¢ Knows each student‚Äôs worst fear

**Plot Hooks:**

‚Ä¢ A player finds a hall pass with their name and the word ‚ÄúRUN‚Äù

‚Ä¢ A survivor from a previous detention refuses to speak, only draws burning doors

‚Ä¢ A teacher insists the east wing was never rebuilt

‚Ä¢ A mirror shows a player being chased, even when they‚Äôre alone

**Connection to the Temple:** The east wing may be a sacrificial ground tied to the temple‚Äôs rituals. The entity could be a failed vessel, still bound to the school and seeking new victims to complete its transformation.

### Scenario: Camp Red Fog

**Premise:** A group of teens arrives at Camp Red Fog for a weekend retreat. The lake is still, the cabins are quiet, and the fog never lifts. On the first night, one camper goes missing. By morning, their tent is shredded and a trail of blood leads into the woods. Something stalks the camp‚Äîwearing the faces of the missing.

**Setting Details:**

‚Ä¢ The Camp:

‚Ä¢ Surrounded by dense forest and a lake that reflects nothing

‚Ä¢ Cabins creak even when empty

‚Ä¢ The fog muffles sound and distorts vision

‚Ä¢ Cell phones only show static

‚Ä¢ The Stalker:

‚Ä¢ Appears as a friend, until it‚Äôs too late

‚Ä¢ Leaves behind masks made of bark and teeth

‚Ä¢ Can‚Äôt be seen directly‚Äîonly in peripheral vision

‚Ä¢ Knows campers‚Äô secrets and mimics their voices

**Plot Hooks:**

‚Ä¢ A player finds a mask with their own face

‚Ä¢ A campfire story matches real events from the night before

‚Ä¢ A counselor insists the camp was closed years ago

‚Ä¢ A player hears their name whispered from the lake

**Connection to the Temple:** The camp may sit atop a buried temple site. The fog could be a protective veil or a containment field. The stalker may be a temple guardian‚Äîor a failed ritual that escaped its bounds.

**Resolution:** By helping the ghost find peace, the players gain insight into the emotional weight of memory and loss, deepening their connection to the supernatural forces at play in the campaign.

### Monster Hunt: The Drain Below

**Setting:** Beneath the town‚Äôs skate park lies a forgotten storm drain system‚Äîtwisting tunnels, rusted grates, and graffiti-covered walls. Strange noises echo from below, and local pets have started disappearing.

- Avoiding flooded chambers and unstable walkways
    
- Interpreting graffiti messages left by past explorers

### Monster Hunt: The Radio Tower

**Setting:** On the outskirts of town stands a long-abandoned radio tower, its skeletal frame looming over the hills. The tower occasionally emits strange signals that interfere with local electronics and cause vivid hallucinations.

- Climbing the unstable structure while avoiding hazards
    
- Resisting the hallucinations and mental distortions

### Monster Hunt: The Video Store Vault

**Setting:** Tucked behind a boarded-up strip mall is an old video rental store, long abandoned but still faintly humming with electricity. The shelves are dusty, the tapes warped, and a flickering ‚ÄúOPEN‚Äù sign glows despite no power source.

**Hook:** A student finds a strange VHS tape labeled ‚ÄúDo Not Watch Alone‚Äù and disappears after viewing it. The players discover the store has reopened itself‚Äîjust for them.

- Avoiding scenes that replay traumatic memories
    
- Interacting with NPCs trapped inside old movies
    
- Solving puzzles using outdated media formats (VHS, Betamax, etc.)

üß™ Monster Fight: Science Fair Meltdown Setting: The school gymnasium, transformed into a bustling science fair. Tables are lined with bubbling volcanoes, solar-powered contraptions, and questionable slime experiments. But something‚Äôs wrong‚Äîone of the projects has started mutating. Hook: A student‚Äôs ‚Äúbio-reactive goo‚Äù project explodes mid-judging, releasing a rapidly growing creature made of fused science fair materials.

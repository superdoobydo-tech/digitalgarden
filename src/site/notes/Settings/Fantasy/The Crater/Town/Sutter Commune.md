### [[Settings/Fantasy/The Crater/Town/Sutter Commune\|Sutter Commune]]


**Stutter's Commune** - Repurposed ruins beyond the village walls, where Sutter Cain and his exiled followers dwell. The commune is built from shattered divine infrastructure and warped stone. Here, Cain paints visions return, and his followers craft dream-echo sculptures. The commune is haunted by whispers and flickers of divine resonance.

Sutter and his followers developed limited magical abilities due to a leak in the Ether Lake's echo chamber while living in [[Settings/Fantasy/The Crater/Town/Hallowspire Village\|Hallowspire Village]]. In the weeks before the ban, Sutter's powers intensified—he entered fugue states and painted visions of the future.

At an art gala, Sutter displayed a painting of the mayor stealing food from the people's plates—a metaphor for the mayor's secret theft from the populace. Enraged, the mayor ordered investigations into the art district. Guards reported strange and abnormal behavior among the residents. Eventually, magic users were discovered and exiled.

### Mysteries

**What Happened to the Artists?**

- **Disease in the Artist District** – The mayor framed the exile as a response to an uncurable disease.
    
- **Exile of the Artists** – Certain artists exhibited signs of inner magic, possibly omens of the gods' return or leaks in the seal. Persuaded by the Tinkerer not to execute them, they were exiled beyond the village.
    
- **Liora's Song** – A haunting melody that lingers in the tavern, said to awaken dormant magic in those who hear it.
    
- **The Echo Chamber** – A hidden chamber beneath the lake that amplifies magical resonance, possibly the source of the leak.
    
- **Sutter's Visions** – Paintings that depict future events, some of which have already come true.

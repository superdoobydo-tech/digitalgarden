### High Executor Virellian Thorne

_When he enters, the room seems to shrink around him. Light falters, and the air grows thin, as if the space itself resents his presence. His skeletal frame moves with ritualistic precision, each step deliberate and slow. Yet every gaze is drawn to him—not by command, but by a pressure that builds in the chest, a silent demand for attention. Frail though he appears, he emanates a gravity that bends the will of even the defiant._

- Supreme authority of Hallowspire
- Gaunt figure draped in crimson robes and bone-thread insignia
- Voice is rarely heard, but his decrees are absolute
- Said to never blink; his gaze alone can silence a crowd
- Feared and revered as a symbol of unwavering control and ideological purity
- Carries the scent of dried blood and old parchment, and his presence chills the air like a tomb cracked open

### Servitor Nyx Virellan

_When she appears, it is never through a door. The air thickens, the shadows stretch, and the scent of ash creeps in like a warning. Her robes trail behind her like spilled ink, and her halo of bone-thread filaments pulses faintly, as if catching whispers from beyond. Her speech is fragmented—half prophecy, half memory—and her eyes seem to look through time itself. She does not threaten. She reveals. And what she reveals cannot be forgotten._

• Servitor to the High Executor
• Spectral presence draped in ink-black silk robes and crowned with bone-thread filaments
• Speech is erratic and fragmented, as if channeling voices from beyond
• Feared for the secrets she knows and truths she reveals
• Said to walk through walls and appear in dreams
• Delivers Thorne’s decrees with cryptic finality
• Arrival always preceded by scent of ash and a shift in the atmosphere
- This is litas unforgiving Boss

## The Echo Vault

The Echo Vault is a chamber of harmonic convergence, carved into the deepest vein of resonance beneath Hallowspire. Designed by Fenwick Gratch and sealed by Liora Venn, it is both tomb and tuning fork‚Äîa place where memory, melody, and machinery intertwine.

The Vault itself sealed behind a massive metallic rolling door, engineered by Fenwick to withstand divine resonance. It can only be opened with the Tinkerer's Key‚Äîa relic forged from memory-metal and tuned to Liora's final chord. Without it, the vault remains closed to all.

Its walls are lined with crystalline plates that shimmer with spectral light, each one vibrating faintly with fragments of Liora's final song.

At the center stands the Resonant Pillar, a spire of alloyed memory-metal that hums with layered echoes. When struck with the correct harmonic frequency, it resonates in a way that renders the Ether Lake inert‚Äîsevering its divine connection.

Liora Venn remains within, eternally singing the chord that seals the Ether Lake. Her voice, once pure and resolute, has frayed with time and divine interference. The gods, though sealed, still whisper through the ether, and their influence has twisted her mind. She sings still‚Äîmad, fragmented, but unwavering. Her melody holds.


## Final Showdown - Sacrifice Persephony

The campaign's climax unfolds within the Echo Vault itself. As the seal begins to fray and divine whispers grow louder, the party must confront Liora Venn‚Äîwhose fragmented mind teeters between memory and madness.

The Resonant Pillar pulses erratically, the crystalline plates flicker with unstable light, and the vault's song begins to shift. The gods press against the seal, seeking return.

Players must decide: restore Liora's harmony, replace her as the anchor, or sever the Ether Lake forever‚Äîat great cost.

The final battle is not just of blade and spell, but of memory, music, and sacrifice.

Victory may silence the gods. Or awaken something worse.

The Echo Vault will remember.

üé≠ Emotional Stakes

- **Liora‚Äôs Fragmented Mind**: She may not recognize the party. She may sing to them as if they were gods. Or children. Or echoes.
- **The Vault Reacts**: As emotions rise, the crystalline plates shift, the Resonant Pillar pulses erratically, and the vault itself begins to reshape.
- **Legacy Choices**: Players must choose‚Äîrestore Liora‚Äôs harmony, replace her as the anchor, or open the Ether Lake forever.

üß© Mechanical Hooks

- **Resonant Collapse**: The gods press against the seal. If Liora falters, divine echoes breach the vault.
- **Harmonic Puzzle**: Players must attune to the vault‚Äôs frequency mid-combat‚Äîsinging, remembering, or sacrificing something personal.
- **Vault Consequences Table**: Each round, the vault reacts to sound, emotion, and intent. Want me to build that?

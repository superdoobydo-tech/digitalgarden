#### Virehold - Central: Farming and Government Tower

The heart of Hallowspire, where the town's meager agricultural efforts struggle against poor soil and harsh conditions. The farms are arranged in a circular pattern surrounding the imposing Government Tower, which looms over the fields as a symbol of control and surveillance. Council officials and enforcers operate from here, issuing decrees and monitoring the populace. Food is heavily guarded, with rations distributed under strict supervision and hoarding punished severely.

• 	Architecture & Atmosphere
	• 	Cold, echoing chambers of stone and steel
	• 	Flickering crimson lanterns casting long, distorted shadows
	• 	Air tinged with oil and dust
	• 	Every sound amplified—footsteps, whispers, creaking hinges
	• 	Security Presence
	• 	Enforcers patrol with mechanical precision and silent, rehearsed movements
	• 	Padded boots mute footsteps, giving the illusion they glide
	• 	Surveillance nodes—small, lens-like devices—embedded in walls track motion and sound

- Finds a mysterious sketchbook tucked into her coat after a routine inspection near the Spire of Law
	• 	Cold stone alcove off a torchlit corridor
	• 	Bolted oak desk with leather-bound ledger, quill, inkwell, and sealing wax
	• 	Iron-bound cabinets stamped with the High Executor’s bone-thread emblem
	• 	Lone tallow candle in a wrought-iron sconce casting flickering light
	• 	High barred arrow-slit window admitting only a sliver of gray sky
	• 	Dancing shadows that whisper every word is watched

### What Happened to the Artists?

Sutter and his followers developed limited magical abilities due to a leak in the Ether Lake's echo chamber while living in Hallowspire. In the weeks before the ban, Sutter's powers intensified—he entered fugue states and painted visions of the future.

The mayor's discovery of the commune's secret came not from a public display, but from a confiscated sketchbook found during a routine inspection of the tavern. Inside were pages of surreal imagery—twisted depictions of divine symbols, distorted portraits of village leaders, and one chilling image: the Spire of Law crumbling into the Ether Lake. Alarmed, the mayor ordered a covert investigation.

Guards infiltrated the Artists' Quarter under the guise of census takers, reporting strange and abnormal behavior among the residents. Eventually, magic users were discovered and exiled.
### Sutter's Room

- _The mayor, hunched and shadowed, stealing coins from a village coffer—his eyes hollow, his hands stained with ink and blood._
    
- _Elric, the Tinkerer, curled in sleep beneath the earth, surrounded by glowing runes and fractured machinery—his breath syncing with the pulse of the a giant Gate._
    
- _The world itself, split down the middle—one half aflame, the other drowned in stars and silence._
    
- _A player character, depicted in the exact clothes they wore upon arrival, standing at the edge of a broken bridge, staring into the Ether Lake._

## Module: Echoes in the Mist

### Overview

A mysterious mist creeps through Gravemarket, whispering secrets and stirring memories. The Crimson Council dismisses it as seasonal fog, but those who know better feel the forest awakening. This module brings together eight unique characters to investigate the Whispering Woods and uncover the truth behind the mist’s growing reach.


## 🧠 Quest Module: _Echoes in the Mist_

**Starting Seed**: Chill discovers Sutter Cain’s sketchbook tucked into his coat during Florence’s funeral. He didn’t bring it. It pulses faintly, and the pages shift when turned.

**Trigger:**

- The sketchbook opens to a page depicting the graveyard twisted into a spiral of roots and screaming faces.
    
- A second page shows a player character standing at the edge of a broken bridge, staring into the Ether Lake.
    
- A third page is blank—but begins to fill with ink when Chill touches it.
    

**Leads:**

- Lexi recognizes one of the symbols as matching a broken carving in her tavern’s basement.
    
- Koarn sees a schematic embedded in the art—matching a device Florence once described.

- Lita feels her eyepatch warm when the sketchbook is near the Whispering Woods.
    

**Optional Encounter:**

**Player Moments:**

- **Tony’s Moment**: Tony seeks out Lyrixa Veil, who runs the art district and may know where Sutter Cain once lived. They engage in a tense back-and-forth skill check—if Tony succeeds, Lyrixa shares the location and a warning. If Tony fails, Lyrixa deflects, and Tony must solve a cipher hidden in the sketchbook to uncover the commune’s coordinates.

- Sutter’s visions are not metaphor—they are warnings.

Located in Stonegate, this is a museum of **propagandized historical accounts** and exhibits. The curator is **Alfred Bledsoe**.

- **Secret:** Alfred Bledsoe once mentored a young woman named **Florence Heyes**. He encouraged her to leave, a decision he now deeply regrets as she was not ready for the challenges. He still hears her cheery voice near the forest, a constant reminder of his failure.

The centerpiece of Ashveil, this towering, iron-latticed amphitheater is where the Crimson Council's sanctioned performances are held. The hall is managed by **Calvara Deyne**, a severe but celebrated conductor. Every surface of the hall is etched with the Council's sigils, serving as a reminder that art exists only to serve doctrine.

- **Secret:** Beneath the stage, in forgotten catacombs, Maestra Calvara Deyne keeps a **hidden archive of unsanctioned works**. While she appears to be the Council's most devoted servant, she is secretly a custodian of forbidden truth, waiting for the day art can be free again.

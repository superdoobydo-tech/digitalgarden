### ðŸŒ² Whispering Woods Detail â€” Integration

Letâ€™s expand the sketchbookâ€™s description to reflect its origin and psychic influence:

> **The cover is barkâ€”soft, fibrous, and whispering.** The tree it came from grew in the **Whispering Woods**, a place where memory and prophecy entwine. When Cassandra holds it, the voices begin. They do not speak in words, but in impressions. The pages are filled with **bizarre illustrations of the future**, drawn by Sutter Cain in a fevered tranceâ€”images that seem to shift when viewed too long.

This elevates the sketchbook from a mysterious object to a **living artifact**, one that actively shapes Cassandraâ€™s perception and choices. It also opens the door for future scenes where the sketchbook might:

- Whisper secrets during Council rituals
    
- Reveal alternate versions of events before they happen
    
- Influence dreams or trigger visions in those who touch it

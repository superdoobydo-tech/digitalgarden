## üïØÔ∏è Act I: The Sketchbook Whispers (Day 1)

| Character         | Suffering Depiction                                                                                                                                                         | Fragment Message                                 |     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Tony              | A marionette puppet performing on stage, strings pulled by faceless figures. Her eyes are wide with panic, her mouth stitched into a smile.                                 | "Fragmented,"                                    |     |
| Lexi              | Hung as a thief in the town square. Her father watches from a bench, expression blank, as officials declare him a ward of the state.                                        | "you falter."                                    |     |
| Chill             | Alone in a vast library, surrounded by unread books. His face is hollow with regret‚Äîrealizing at the end of his life that nothing changed, and he did nothing to change it. | "As one,"                                        |     |
| Koarn             | Kneeling in a flooded chamber, clutching a broken schematic. Above him, Florence‚Äôs silhouette turns away. The water rises.                                                  | "you"                                            |     |
| Lita              | Standing before a tribunal of masked figures. Her eyepatch is removed, revealing a glowing mark. She is declared ‚Äúunfit to return.‚Äù Behind her, the forest leans in.        | "rise."                                          |     |
| WHEN PUT TOGETHER | the the sky is clear, the forest recedes, the tower is fallen and the town is vibrant and renewed                                                                           | TURNS INTO SUTTERS SIGNATURE TONY SUGGEST LYRIXA |     |

### üéº Tony‚Äôs Scene: The Fog Refrain
Mist clings to the city streets, curling around lampposts and cobblestones like breath held too long. Tony hums her grandmother‚Äôs song‚Äîsoft, half-remembered, the kind that used to calm her during storms. As she approaches the Bronze Buck, the fog parts in front of her, unnaturally clean, like a curtain drawn back.

She stops humming.

The silence is immediate. No footsteps. No wind. No tavern clatter. Just stillness.
Then she sees her: her grandmother, standing in the street, coat buttoned wrong, eyes distant. Her mouth doesn‚Äôt move, but Tony hears the words clearly:

The fog swallows her again. The silence lingers.

‚Ä¢ 	Tony seeks out Lyrixa Veil, who runs the art district and may know where Sutter Cain once lived.
‚Ä¢ 	They engage in a tense back-and-forth skill check (Insight, Persuasion, or Performance).
‚Ä¢ 	Success: Lyrixa shares the location and offers a cryptic warning: ‚ÄúHe left echoes. Don‚Äôt follow them too closely.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ 	Failure: Lyrixa deflects, claiming ignorance. Tony must solve a musical cipher hidden in the sketchbook to uncover the commune‚Äôs coordinates.
‚Ä¢ 	The cipher appears as distorted notation‚Äînotes that shift key signatures when viewed in different light.
‚Ä¢ 	Solving it may require help from Myra or referencing the original Anthem found in Lexi‚Äôs basement.

### üçæ Lexi hosts the funeral, pressured by banker Davenport.  Thomas Glass was to be the one to inherit the tavern, not Irene.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a funeral,‚Äù she mutters. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a ledger being balanced.‚Äù

Davenport - i dont know how you pay the bill but sinve your doing so well you can foot the funeral bill CHILL SEES

Would you like me to riff a visual motif for the spiral map or build a mechanic where the sketchbook reacts differently depending on who‚Äôs holding it? I can also suggest how the Null Choir might respond if players try to skip pages.

**Trigger:**

- The sketchbook opens to a page depicting the graveyard twisted into a spiral of roots and screaming faces.
    
- A second page shows a KOARN standing in a huge metallic room staring up at the Ether Lake.
    
- A third page is blank‚Äîbut begins to fill with ink when Chill touches it.
    

**Leads:**

- Lexi recognizes one of the symbols as matching a broken carving in her tavern‚Äôs basement.
    
- Koarn sees a schematic embedded in the art‚Äîmatching a device Florence once described.
    
- Tony finds a cipher in the margins‚Äîmusical notation that matches Lyrixa Veil‚Äôs sheet.
    
- Lita feels her eyepatch warm when the sketchbook is near the Whispering Woods.
    

**Optional Encounter:**

- A villager approaches Chill, claiming to have seen Florence walking near the graveyard last night.
    
- The mist thickens. A voice calls Chill‚Äôs name‚Äîbut no one else hears it.
    

**Player Moments:**

## üå´Ô∏è Act II: Commune Echoes (Day 2)

- A sculpture of Florence hums when Koarn approaches.
    
- A painting shows the mayor hunched over a coffer, bleeding ink.
    
- A sculpture of Lyrixa Veil holds Tony‚Äôs eyes open to an upside-down music book.
    

**Revelations:**

- The commune was built atop shattered divine infrastructure.
    
- The Echo Chamber beneath the lake is leaking.
    
- Sutter‚Äôs visions are not metaphor‚Äîthey are warnings.
    
- The graveyard is not a resting place. It is a mouth.

### üëÅÔ∏è Act III: The Graveyard Beckons (Day 3)

**Trigger:**

- The sketchbook‚Äôs final page fills in overnight: ‚ÄúResolve the spiral. Or the forest will feed.‚Äù
    
- Nyx‚Äôs directive echoes in Lita‚Äôs mind. Her exile looms.
    

**Graveyard Setup:**

- The mist is thicker. The soil churns.
    
- Graves are missing. The crypt hums.
    
- The Null Choir begins to stir‚Äîdrawn by sound, memory, and grief.
    

**Optional Tactics:**

- Players can prepare with fire, light, silence, or commune artifacts.

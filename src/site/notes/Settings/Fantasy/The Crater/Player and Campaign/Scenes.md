#### 📣 Cassandra Vale — The Sketchbook and the Song

- Finds a mysterious sketchbook tucked into her coat after a routine inspection near the Spire of Law
    
- Contacts Elira discreetly to help locate the artist, Sutter Cain
    
- Elira agrees to meet, cautious but curious, remembering the commune and her own connection to the fog
    

#### 🍺 Irene Glass — The Funeral She Didn’t Choose


- Talking with staff and father then 
	
- Forced to host a funeral at the Bronze Buck Tavern by Robert Davenport
    
- Davenport is a condescending banker who enforces tradition and profit
    
- The funeral is for a ranking official whose death has stirred whispers


## 🎶 Elira Graysong — The Voice on the Edge - Before Funeral
### 🎭 Scene: _The Lesson Between the Notes_

**Location**: Gloamspire Hall, rehearsal chamber—dimly lit, lined with sigils, acoustically perfect. The Anthem is scheduled in two hours.

- **Lyrixa Veil** stands tall, her silver-streaked hair braided into a crown of thorns. Her robes are austere, her voice clipped and cold.
    
- **Elira**, posture perfect, eyes forward, waits for correction. She’s sung this passage a hundred times. But today, Lyrixa pauses.
    

#### 🗣️ Dialogue Beats

- **Lyrixa (quietly)**: “You strike every note. You follow every breath mark. And yet… it does not linger.” _(She steps closer, her voice barely above a whisper.)_ “The Anthem must not only be heard. It must be felt. Even if they never admit it.”
    
- **Elira (confused)**: “But the Council forbids interpretation. Emotion is distortion.”
    
- **Lyrixa (smiling faintly)**: “They forbid indulgence. Not resonance.” _(She places a hand over Elira’s heart.)_ “You know she was also a student of mine... Sing it again. But this time… remember her.”
    
- **Elira** closes her eyes. She sees her grandmother in the fog, mouthing silent words. She sings—not louder, not differently—but with weight. The chamber hums.
    
- **Lyrixa (turning away)**: “Good. That will do.” _(She exits without praise, but leaves behind a single sheet of music—annotated with symbols Elira doesn’t recognize.)_
    

#### 🎼 Optional Mechanics

- **Hidden Notation**: The sheet Lyrixa leaves contains a cipher—an old commune code for emotional phrasing
    
- **Fog Echo**: Elira’s performance subtly alters the acoustics of the hall, revealing a hidden passage beneath the stage
    
- **Council Risk**: If another performer overhears, Elira may be summoned for “doctrinal review”

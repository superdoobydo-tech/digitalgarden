| Tony              | A marionette puppet performing on stage, strings pulled by faceless figures. Her eyes are wide with panic, her mouth stitched into a smile.                                 | "Fragmented,"                                    |     |
| Lexi              | Hung as a thief in the town square. Her father watches from a bench, expression blank, as officials declare him a ward of the state.                                        | "you falter."                                    |     |
| Chill             | Alone in a vast library, surrounded by unread books. His face is hollow with regret‚Äîrealizing at the end of his life that nothing changed, and he did nothing to change it. | "As one,"                                        |     |
| Koarn             | Kneeling in a flooded chamber, clutching a broken schematic. Above him, Florence‚Äôs silhouette turns away. The water rises.                                                  | "you"                                            |     |
| Lita              | Standing before a tribunal of masked figures. Her eyepatch is removed, revealing a glowing mark. She is declared ‚Äúunfit to return.‚Äù Behind her, the forest leans in.        | "rise."                                          |     |
| WHEN PUT TOGETHER | the the sky is clear, the forest recedes, the tower is fallen and the town is vibrant and renewed                                                                           | TURNS INTO SUTTERS SIGNATURE TONY SUGGEST LYRIXA |     |

### üéº Tony‚Äôs Scene: The Fog Refrain
Mist clings to the city streets, curling around lampposts and cobblestones like breath held too long. Tony hums her grandmother‚Äôs song‚Äîsoft, half-remembered, the kind that used to calm her during storms. As she approaches the Bronze Buck, the fog parts in front of her, unnaturally clean, like a curtain drawn back.

She stops humming.

The silence is immediate. No footsteps. No wind. No tavern clatter. Just stillness.
Then she sees her: her grandmother, standing in the street, coat buttoned wrong, eyes distant. Her mouth doesn‚Äôt move, but Tony hears the words clearly:

The fog swallows her again. The silence lingers.



### üçæ Lexi hosts the funeral, pressured by banker Davenport.  Thomas Glass was to be the one to inherit the tavern, not Irene.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a funeral,‚Äù she mutters. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a ledger being balanced.‚Äù

Davenport - i dont know how you pay the bill but sinve your doing so well you can foot the funeral bill CHILL SEES

- Mechanics: She‚Äôs overcome by ether-touched grief. PCs can attempt a DC 14 Performance or Insight to steady her.

- Interaction: Lita (or the party) can make a DC 13 Insight to see his bouquet conceals a coded love note‚Äîand a sketch of the forest‚Äôs spiral path.
    
- Payoff: If Lita responds kindly, Silas offers to guide the group through the woods to avoid council patrols.


### The Silent Pallbearer

- A young apprentice hesitates at the coffin, unable to lift it.

## Encounter 7: The Unruly Mourner

A bleary-eyed guest‚ÄîMaris Wynn, a minor artisan‚Äîhas drunk too much mourning ale and is now stumbling through the service, threatening to upend Lexi‚Äôs carefully arranged ceremony. If the party doesn‚Äôt intervene, every spilled goblet and shouted slur will reflect badly on her.

### Setup

As Lexi delivers the closing rites, Maris staggers forward, nearly toppling a mourning wreath and slurring accusations: ‚ÄúYou only care about coin, not Cain‚Äôs memory!‚Äù

### Mechanics

1. Spotting Trouble
    
    - Perception DC 12 to notice her weaving toward the altar before chaos erupts.
        
2. Calming Maris
    
    - Persuasion DC 13: coax her down with gentle words and a reminder of Sutter‚Äôs honor.
        
    - Insight DC 13: learn she‚Äôs raging at perceived injustice‚Äîmentioning a missing payment to her workshop.
        
3. Avoiding Collateral
    
    - Dexterity DC 12 to catch or dodge the thrown tankard of ale (¬Ω cover if successful; 1d4 bludgeoning and soaked clothes on failure).

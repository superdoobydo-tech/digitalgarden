## **Chrome & Code Archetypes: Detailed Write-Ups**

These tables provide the full profile for each of the seven core Archetypes, integrating their recommended **Hustle Styles** and their three **Signature Specializations**.
  
### The Corpo

You are the architect of the cage. Your enemies don't fear a gun; they fear the silence that follows your name when you blacklist them from existence. You traded your humanity for a window office and a severance package worth a thousand lives. Power is not fire or steel; it is _leverage_, it is the systems you control, and it is the cold logic that dictates who lives and who becomes a line item on a quarterly report. The street runs on muscle, but the city runs on your command. You are the suit in the shadow, and the Megacorp is your weapon.

---
The Corpo is the architect of control, leveraging finance, information, and leverage from the megacorp's highest echelons.

| **Flaws**                     | **Enemy** (A disgraced rival) or **System Trace** (Security protocols track their spending). | Their power generates powerful rivals, and their digital life leaves clear footprints.            |

### The Gangster

You are the engine of chaos, a walking arsenal of pain forged in the fires of the abandoned districts. Loyalty is currency, and fear is the only law that matters. You don’t ask for resources; you take them at the point of a chromed fist and a high-caliber integrated weapon. You understand that in this neon jungle, only the quick, the brutal, and the heavily augmented survive. Every scar is a memoir, and every piece of chrome is a promise of violence. You are the shadow of the law, the enforcer of the concrete sprawl.

---
The Gangster is the enforcer of the streets, living by a brutal, tactical code that values raw, augmented force and loyalty.

|Element|Focus & Advantage|Rationale|
|---|---|---|

|**Flaws**|**Enemy** (Rival gang boss or focused police task force) or **Addiction** (To combat drugs or stims).|Their visible lifestyle guarantees constant turf battles and reliance on substances to maintain an edge.|

### The Hacker

You are the ghost in the machine, a digital phantom who sees the physical world as a slow, clumsy network of nodes and weaknesses. The net is your playground, your church, and your sanctuary. You bypass the thickest firewalls like wet paper, dancing through encrypted data streams while your physical body sits in a dark, empty room. To others, the Megacorp is a behemoth; to you, it's just one massive, flawed system waiting for the right exploit. You move faster than light, and anonymity is your armor.

---
The Hacker is the ghost in the machine, a digital phantom who manipulates data streams and bypasses defenses from the digital realm.

| **Flaws**                     | **System Trace** (A piece of code that constantly follows them) or **Glitched Implant** (A faulty jack or neural ware). | Their existence is tied to the net, making them vulnerable to digital counter-attacks and code flaws. |

### The Technomancer

You are the puppeteer, the terrifying evolution of the hacker. Your target isn't a firewall—it's the flesh-and-steel system wired beneath a person's skin. You don't steal data; you hijack motor functions, spike nerve endings, and rewrite memory on the fly. To your allies, you are the quick patch that restores system stability; to your enemies, you are the silent, invisible violation of their physical autonomy. Every piece of chrome they wear is a microphone for your command, and every heartbeat is a vulnerability.

---
The Technomancer specializes in hacking implants and neuralware to seize control of enemies and optimize allies, viewing the body as a network.

| **Flaws**                     | **Glitched Implant** (Own neural link compromised) or **System Trace** (Deep-level hacks leave dangerous digital footprints). | A single mistake means losing control, leaving a breadcrumb trail, or suffering system backlash.       |

### The Drone Tech

You trust code over flesh, and steel over skin. Your machines are not tools; they are your loyal children—your eyes in the sky, your guns on the ground, and the shields that protect your vital organs. You are the engineer of the frontier, a master of remote destruction and complex mechanical logistics. While others fight with their hands, you orchestrate a ballet of violence through servos, sensors, and satellite links. Your workbench is your temple, and the language of circuitry is your mother tongue.

---
The Drone Tech is the mechanical expert, mastering automated systems, weaponry, and bio-modding; their loyalty is often to their machines.

### The Nomad

The city is a poison, and you are the antidote. You live by the code of the dust and the road, a survivalist who prefers the lawless wastes to the tyranny of corporate skyscrapers. You are the courier, the smuggler, and the expert in vehicular combat, a crucial link between the shattered remnants of civilization. Your vehicle is your home, your fortress, and your greatest weapon. You are the symbol of freedom that the Megacorps tried, and failed, to erase—always moving, always surviving.

---

|Element|Focus & Advantage|Rationale|
|---|---|---|

|**Signature Specializations**|**REFLEX-SHIMMER, MORTAL COIL, HULL INTEGRITY**|Core power is high-speed defense, mastery of vehicle/long-range weapons, and enduring resilience.|
|**Available Hustle Styles**|**Street Reclaimer, Augment Runner, System Scavenger**|Survives by the dangerous transport of rare goods, parts, and information, or taking needed resources from the wastes.|
|**Flaws**|**Enemy** (A rival nomadic clan or local warlord) or **Glitched Implant** (Essential vehicle diagnostics or navigation ware failing).|Life on the road means constant mechanical threats and territorial disputes are unavoidable.|

### The Street Prophet

You are the voice of the voiceless, the fiery counterpoint to the corporate media's lie. You don't use tech to fight the system; you use _conviction_. Your weapon is charisma, your armor is faith, and your purpose is to wake the masses from their engineered slumber. You inspire loyalty where others sow fear, and you speak truth where others sell fantasy. You are a dangerous, highly visible figure—a messiah to the forgotten and a political target to the powerful. You are the moral compass, spinning wildly in the dark.

---

## Archetype Specific Flaws Matrix

| Archetype          | Flaw Option A: **Physical/Augment Failure**                                                                                                                                                                                       | Flaw Option B: **Social/Rivalry**                                                                                                                                    | Flaw Option C: **System/Digital Vulnerability**                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Corpo**          | **Bioshock Addiction:** You rely on high-grade combat stims (pain/focus) to function. Suffer a **-1 penalty** to all rolls if you haven't recently ingested a stim.                                                               | **Disgraced Rival:** A former peer is actively trying to ruin your life, having evidence of a major past crime.                                                      | **System Trace:** Your executive-grade augments are passively monitored, leaving a traceable digital trail of your movements and interactions.                               |
| **Gangster**       | **Decay Overload:** You have too much unstable chrome. Suffer a permanent **-1 penalty** to all **Wits** rolls due to constant system strain and physical pain.                                                                   | **Marked Territory:** A powerful rival gang or warlord claims your territory. Any activity there attracts immediate, violent attention.                              | **Hotspot Marker:** You are flagged by the local police/security AI as a high-risk offender, resulting in increased surveillance and randomized ID checks.                   |
| **Hacker**         | **Glitched Implant:** Your primary neuralware sometimes fails. Suffer a permanent **-1 penalty** to all **Technology** rolls until you can spend a full scene fixing the glitch.                                                  | **Targeted Data:** You are the sole repository of information a Megacorp desperately wants. They will commit any resource to extract the data from your mind.        | **Residual Trace:** Your last major hack left a piece of self-replicating hostile code (an AI splinter) inside your own system that occasionally compromises your data.      |
| **Technomancer**   | **Psychic Backlash:** Using high-level **MIND SHACKLE** powers causes extreme disorientation. Suffer a **-2 dice penalty** on all rolls in the round immediately following a successful use of a Level 4+ **MIND SHACKLE** power. | **Network Nemesis:** A rival Technomancer or AI is obsessed with neutralizing you, often sending counter-hacks and digital distractions.                             | **Unstable Interface:** Your custom-built interface causes physical strain. Any time you spend **Decay**, you suffer 1 point of **Superficial Damage** from system feedback. |
| **Drone Tech**     | **Component Dependency:** Your drones rely on a unique, non-standard component only available from one highly hostile source.                                                                                                     | **Stolen Blueprint:** You stole the core tech for your best drone/machine from a powerful, small rival corporation who is actively tracking the machine's signature. | **Drone Override Risk:** There is a 50% chance that any hostile **NET DOMAIN** or **MIND SHACKLE** hack on your drone redirects a lesser counter-hack onto _your_ system.    |
| **Nomad**          | **Damaged Rig:** Your primary vehicle (your home/asset) has a catastrophic, hard-to-fix mechanical flaw that activates at the worst possible time (GM's discretion).                                                              | **Tribal Vendetta:** Your former Nomad clan believes you betrayed them. Clan members treat you as an absolute, hostile enemy on sight.                               | **Geo-Lock:** Your movement is restricted by a digital or territorial boundary enforced by a local warlord, making certain critical areas effectively impassable.            |
| **Street Prophet** | **Messianic Complex:** You are fundamentally unable to prioritize your own needs over your followers/mission. You must spend 1 **Willpower** to take an action that is purely self-serving.                                       | **Media Scourge:** A powerful media executive or religious leader treats you as public enemy number one, using their resources to broadcast lies about you daily.    | **Public Tracing:** Your need to broadcast your message means your communications are constantly scanned and traced, making any private digital conversation a high risk.    |

## Flaws

These Flaws introduce core narrative challenges, resource drains, and social complications that the player must manage throughout the game.

### Physical & Augment Flaws (The Body)

|Flaw Name|Effect & Consequence (Narrative Focus)|Roleplay Trigger & Mechanic|
|---|---|---|
|**Glitched Implant**|Your primary augment (e.g., cyber-arm, optic-ware) fails unpredictably. Once per session, your primary Augment skill (e.g., Brawl, Ranged) fails entirely, forcing you to rely on a different approach.|The GM can declare the failure when the character is relying heavily on the augment.|
|**Visible Decay**|Your augmentations are visibly causing your flesh to rot, or you have massive, unstable scarring. **Unaugmented** people will rarely allow you into their homes or vehicles; you must spend **1 Willpower** to try.|Dealing with the pervasive fear of augment rejection in the general population.|
|**Augment Glutton**|Your chrome is power-hungry. You must spend **2 points** of the **Resources** Background (or equivalent) at the end of every session to acquire batteries/fuel. Failure means your non-Specialization chrome is dead until recharged.|A constant, expensive resource drain necessary just to function.|
|**Chronic Pain**|Your body is constantly wracked by low-grade pain. When you succeed on an **Attack** roll, you must pass a **Composure** roll (Difficulty 2) or immediately gain **1 point of Superficial Damage** from the physical exertion.|High-stress exertion is costly to your internal system.|
|**Loud Runner**|Your augments are noisy (clanks, whirs, servo whine). You can never take the **Stealth** skill, or any associated roll, as a Minor Action; it always consumes a full **Standard Action**.|Infiltration is always slow and deliberate for you.|
|**Mismatched Parts**|Your augments are incompatible. You require a unique chemical stabilizer every 3 days. If you miss a dose, you suffer a **-2 dice penalty** on all **Stamina** rolls until stabilized.|Forces a constant side quest to acquire a rare, black-market drug.|
|**System Aching**|Your body rejects the implanted tech. If you use **any Specialization ability** that costs **Decay**, you are **Immobilized** for your next Minor Action due to system shock.|Extreme effort always causes your body to seize up.|
|**Obvious Chrome**|Your augments are visible, dirty, and frightening. **Persuasion** rolls dealing with anyone outside a combat zone are made at a **-2 dice penalty**.|You cannot blend into normal society or corporate settings.|
|**Blind Spot**|Your vision has a permanent flaw (optic flare, latency). You can never achieve a **Critical Success** on a **Ranged Attack** roll.|Limits high-end specialization in marksmanship.|
|**Fragile**|You are physically delicate. When you take the **Guard** or **Defend** action, the cost to convert **Superficial Damage** to **Lethal Damage** is always one box greater than normal.|Your body simply cannot absorb damage the way others can.|

---

### Social & Background Flaws (The Street)

|Flaw Name|Effect & Consequence (Narrative Focus)|Roleplay Trigger & Mechanic|
|---|---|---|
|**Destitute**|You are truly broke. You must spend at least **2 hours** per day working a menial job or scavenging to afford food and water, or suffer **1 Superficial Damage** per day from starvation.|A constant time/activity drain just for basic survival.|
|**Obsessive Creditor**|A specific, powerful NPC (Fixer, Gang Boss) treats you as property. Once per session, the GM may force you to spend one session working on a high-risk job _for them_ before pursuing your own goals.|External obligations frequently derail your plans.|
|**Fugitive Status**|You have no legal identity. You cannot use any major corporate services (banks, hospitals, public transport). You must acquire **forged documents** or find a contact every time you need to use a public system.|Forces reliance on black-market services and low-tech solutions.|
|**Wanted Profile**|You are wanted for a visible, publicized crime. Anytime you are in a public space, the GM may trigger a scene where you are instantly recognized and targeted by security or bounty hunters.|Your past constantly puts you and your allies in danger.|
|**Code of Honor**|You adhere to a rigid moral code (e.g., never harm the defenseless). You must spend **2 Willpower** (instead of 1) to violate this code.|A high mental cost to compromise your integrity.|
|**Target of Gossip**|You are a subject of constant, public slander. NPCs (even allies) who hear the gossip are **Frightened** (suffer **-2 dice penalty** on all rolls) when dealing with you until you pass a **Persuasion** roll (Difficulty 3).|Rumors are weaponized against you.|
|**Outsider Status**|You are a known "foreigner." Locals in any territory that is not your home turf will never fully trust you. You may not receive aid from the **Allies** Background outside your own district.|Limits your social network to your immediate location.|
|**Social Leper**|Due to a past act, many refuse to associate with you. You cannot enter any secure facility (Corpo tower, private club) without a massive disguise; simply wearing a suit is not enough.|Extreme social restriction in high-end areas.|
|**Political Liability**|You are publicly tied to a failed faction. Any successful **Persuasion** or **Manipulation** roll you make against an official NPC (Cop, Corpo, Politician) will result in a **Security Response** being triggered in the next scene.|You cannot solve problems with authority through social means.|
|**Compromising Habit**|You have a visible, illegal public habit (e.g., street gambling, chemical stim use). You must pass a **Composure** roll (Difficulty 3) to resist engaging in the habit when stressed or under pressure.|A personal weakness that frequently exposes you to unnecessary risk.|

---

### Mental & Psychological Flaws (The Mind)

|Flaw Name|Effect & Consequence (Narrative Focus)|Roleplay Trigger & Mechanic|
|---|---|---|
|**Trauma Triggers**|A specific sight, sound, or word causes you to freeze. On exposure, you are **Immobilized** for one full round (must pass a **Composure** check, Diff 4, to act).|Forces sudden, debilitating vulnerability in combat or high-stress situations.|
|**Digital Compulsion**|You are addicted to the net or a sensory chip. If you haven't "jacked in" in the last 6 hours, all rolls are made at a **-1 dice penalty** due to withdrawal.|A constant, time-consuming addiction that threatens operational security.|
|**Augment Paranoia**|You believe all your chrome is compromised. Before using any **Specialization ability**, you must take a Minor Action to run a **System Check** on your gear.|Adds a critical delay to using your core abilities.|
|**Weak-Willed**|You are easily led. The difficulty for any foe to use **MIND SHACKLE** or **CROWD PULSE** on you is reduced by **1**.|You are uniquely vulnerable to psychic and social manipulation.|
|**Impulsive**|You act rashly. Before making a complicated plan (more than 2 steps), you must pass a **Composure** roll (Difficulty 3) or immediately take the most direct, aggressive course of action.|Your natural instinct is always to leap before you look.|
|**Sensory Overload**|Extreme crowds/noise cause debilitating discomfort. While in a **Dense Crowd** or a **Loud Venue**, you cannot make a **Wits** roll, as your senses are too scrambled.|Forces you to abandon certain environments entirely.|
|**Technophobe**|You have a phobia of advanced robotics or AI. Anytime you encounter a powerful drone or combat AI, you must spend **1 Willpower** to avoid fleeing or freezing.|High mental cost to confront a major modern threat.|
|**Digital Amnesia**|You struggle to retain digital information. You may only memorize **one new password or digital code** per session. Older data is forgotten.|Constantly forces you to find new ways to access secure information.|
|**Haunted Past**|You are tormented by a past failure. When an event reminds you of this past, you must spend the rest of the scene making amends or obsessing over the past situation (GM's discretion).|A narrative hook that frequently pulls you into old, unresolved conflicts.|
|**Shaky Resolve**|When attempting to resist a powerful social force (**Intimidation, Manipulation**), you must spend **1 Willpower** just to make the roll, not to gain a bonus.|Your mental defenses require critical effort even to activate.|

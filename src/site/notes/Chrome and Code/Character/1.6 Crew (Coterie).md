# The Crew: Group Identity and Mechanics

In _Chrome & Code_, the players are not a Coterie; they are a **Crew**â€”a loose collection of specialized talent held together by mutual need, shared risks, and a common goal. Your Crew is your only safety net in a city that wants you dead, indebted, or exploited.

## 1. Defining the Crew's Foundation

Instead of a Coterie's **Type** (e.g., Blood Cult, Sheriff), a Crew defines itself by its primary **Hustle** and its **Turf**.

|V5 Coterie Analogue|Chrome & Code Crew Mechanic|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Coterie Type**|**Crew Hustle**|The primary, often illegal, means by which the Crew generates income, resources, or political leverage.|
|**Coterie Locus**|**Crew Turf**|The physical location or digital network the Crew claims as their base of operations and primary source of power.|
|**Coterie Flaw**|**Crew Complication**|A persistent, external threat or internal liability that targets the entire Crew and creates story conflict.|

### Crew Hustle Options (Examples)

|Hustle Name|Focus|Core Objective|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Broker**|Information and Subterfuge|Selling, manipulating, or weaponizing stolen digital secrets (corporate, political, personal).|
|**Augment Runner**|Smuggling and Force|Moving high-value, illegal goods (chrome, weapons, drugs) across hostile territory.|
|**System Scavenger**|Technology and Repair|Salvaging high-grade materials from dangerous, abandoned, or guarded sites to fund the group.|
|**Digital Samaritan**|Social/Support|Using tech and influence to help the disenfranchised, often fighting corps through activism or protection.|

### Crew Complication Options (Examples)

- **Corporate Task Force:** A specific, well-funded security division has a standing contract to eliminate your Crew.
    
- **Territorial Rivalry:** A powerful, organized gang is constantly attempting to annex your Crew's turf.
    
- **The Blacklist:** Your entire Crew has been successfully banned from using a critical city resource (e.g., the primary docks, the major banking network).
    
- **Internal Parasite:** One member of the Crew (or a key Ally) is a spy for a powerful enemy, constantly leaking sensitive information.
    

## 2. Shared Backgrounds and Resources

All members of a Crew pool their collective power through two shared, critical Backgrounds:

### **Crew Cache (Analogue to Shared Resources)**

This is the pooled physical wealth, equipment, safehouses, and maintenance parts the Crew possesses.

- When purchasing a large asset or performing general maintenance, the Crew uses the highest **Resources** Background rating among its members, potentially adding +1 for every additional member with a high **Resources** rating.
    
- The **Crew Cache** can be attacked. If the Crew's Turf is breached, the Cache rating can be temporarily reduced.
    

### **Crew Network (Analogue to Shared Contacts/Allies)**

This is the collective pool of favors, contacts, and allies the Crew can call upon.

- When accessing a shared ally or contact (e.g., "The Fixer," "The Tech Specialist"), the Crew uses the highest **Contacts** or **Allies** rating among its members.
    
- Damage to the Crew's reputation or a major failure can reduce the reliability of the **Crew Network**.
    

## 3. The Crew's Role in Session Play

The Crew's defined identity allows the Storyteller to tailor challenges specifically to the group's makeup:

1. **Hustle Focus:** Challenges should frequently force the Crew to execute their **Hustle** in high-stakes situations. (e.g., A **Data Broker** Crew must breach a network before a timer runs out).
    
2. **Complication Activation:** At least once per session, the **Crew Complication** should manifest, forcing the players to abandon their immediate goal to deal with the threat to their existence.
    
3. **Moral Cost:** The actions required to maintain the Crew's power often directly test the individual **Humanity** scores of its members, forcing them to commit acts of callousness or violence to keep the group alive.

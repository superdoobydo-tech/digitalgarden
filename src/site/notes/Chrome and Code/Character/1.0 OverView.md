## **CHROME & CODE: CHARACTER CREATION**

Follow these 9 steps to create your augmented character, a being of flesh and machine struggling for survival and meaning in the techno-dystopia. Your central challenge is managing **DECAY**—the continuous physical, mental, and ethical breakdown caused by scarcity and system failure.

---

### Step 1: Concept, Archetype, & Drive

Define your core identity. All life revolves around the pursuit of resources and influence.

  
- **Archetype:** Choose one Archetype that defines your primary access and skills: **Corpo, Gangster, Hacker, Drone Tech,** or **Nomad.**
    
- **Ambition (Long-Term Goal):** Your ultimate, driving purpose (e.g., _"Hijack the city's surveillance grid"_).
    
- **Desire (Short-Term Craving):** Your immediate craving (e.g., _"Earn the trust of a rogue AI"_).
    

### Step 2: Select Attributes

Distribute points across the nine Attributes.

- **Distribution:** 1 Attribute at **4**, 3 Attributes at **3**, 4 Attributes at **2**, and 1 Attribute at **1**.
    

|Category|Attributes|
|---|---|
|**Physical**|Strength, Dexterity, Stamina|
|**Social**|Charisma, Manipulation, Composure|
|**Mental**|Intelligence, Wits, Resolve|

### Step 3: Select Skills

Choose one of the following spreads based on your desired expertise.

| Spread                 | 1 Skill at | 2 Skills at | 3 Skills at | 4 Skills at |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Jack of All Trades** | 10         | 8           | 1           | —           |
| **Balanced**           | 7          | 5           | 3           | —           |
| **Specialist**         | 3          | 3           | 3           | 1           |

### Step 4: SELECT SPECIALIZATIONS

Your unique powers and capabilities are called **Specializations**, reflecting areas of expertise and augmented ability gained through focused training or technological enhancement.

- Start with **2 dots in one Specialization** and **1 dot in a second Specialization**.
    
- **Specialization Examples:** **Cyberware** (Implants, bio-modding), **Heavy Weapons** (Devastating Firepower), **Melee Weapons** (Augmented Combat), **Intimidation** (Psychological Warfare).
    

### Step 5: Choose Hustle Style & Compulsion

Your survival method dictates how you secure resources, and your **Compulsion** dictates your critical flaws under pressure.

- **Hustle Style:** Choose how you **Make Ends Meat** (e.g., Street Reclaimer, Social Hacker, Network Leech, Corporate Parasite, Ritual Feeder, or Proxy Broker).
    
- **Compulsion:** Determine the condition that triggers your personal failure under stress (e.g., _Corpo compelled to Domination_).
    

### Step 6: Choose Edges and Flaws

You have **7 points** to spend on **Edges**. You can take up to **7 points of Flaws** to gain additional Edge points.

|Edge Type|Examples|
|---|---|
|**Backgrounds** (Social Edges)|Allies, Resources, Fame, Safehouses.|
|**BIOS MODS** (Inherent Edges)|Iron Will, Eidetic Memory, Cybernetic Reflexes.|
|**Flaws** (Liabilities)|Enemy, Addiction, System Trace, Glitched Implant.|

### Step 7: Define Convictions & Touchstones

These are your last remaining anchors to sanity and ethics in the corporate sprawl.

- **Convictions:** Establish 1-3 personal moral codes you cannot break.
    
- **Touchstones:** Name 1-3 mortals or memories that emotionally anchor your character.
    

### Step 8: Calculate Derived Attributes

Calculate your starting stats based on your Attribute choices.

- **Health:** Stamina + 3
    
- **Willpower:** Resolve + Composure
    
- **Humanity:** Starts at **7**
    
- **Cyberware Rating (Potency):** Starts at **1**
    
- **Decay (Breakdown/Scarcity):** Starts at **1**
    

### Step 9: Finish the Build

Name your character, define their look, and choose starting gear.

- **Equipment:** Choose appropriate gear based on your Background and Resources.
    
- **Chronicle Tenets:** Ensure your character's goals align with the campaign's core moral boundaries.
    
- **Crew Role:** Define your character's function in the **Crew** (your small group).

## **Resource Mechanics: DECAY and The Hustle**

### ⚙️ The DECAY Mechanic

**DECAY** replaces the Hunger statistic and Cyberware Rating combined, acting as a core measure of physical and psychological breakdown.

- **Rises when:** You fail your **Making Ends Meat Roll** or when your Cyberware is pushed past its safety threshold.
    
- **Impact:** When high, **DECAY** triggers your **Compulsion**.
    

### The Threat of DECAY

When **DECAY** is high, your character is actively deteriorating:

- **Decay Dice:** You add your current **DECAY** rating in dice to certain rolls (including those using your **Specializations** or survival checks). A messy critical fail on a Decay die can trigger your **Compulsion** or cause a painful **Cyberware Glitch** (system failure, temporary loss of an implant function, or physical damage).
    
- **Reducing Decay:** Can be reduced through rest, successful black market trading, fulfilling a personal **Desire**, or successfully repairing/upgrading failing implants.
